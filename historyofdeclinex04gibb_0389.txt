waste is-converted into a fertile soil; the seed, the manure, thc la-
bour, create a new value, and the rewards of harvest are painfullv
earned by the fatigues of the revolving year. In the successivc states
of society, the hunter, the ffiepherd, the hulbandrnan, may defend
their poffessions by two reasons which forcibly appeal to the :feel-
ings of the human mind: that whatever they enjoy is the fruit of
their own industry; and, that every man who envies their felicity,
may purchase similar acquisitione by the exercise of similar diligence.
Such, in truth, may be the freedom and plenty of a small colony
cast on a fruitful issand. But the colony muldplies, while the space
still continues the same: the common rightS, the equal inheritance
of mankind, are engroffed by the bold and crafty; each field and
forest is circumscribed by the land-marks of a jealous master3 and
it is the peculiar praise of the Roman jurisprudence, that it afferte
the claim of the first occupant to the wild animale of the earth5 the
air, and the waters. In the progress from primitive equity to final ine·
justice, the steps are silent, the shades are almost imperceptible, and the
absolute rnonopoly is guarded by pofitive laws and artificial reason.
The active insatiate principle of sels-love can alone supply the arts
of life and the wages ofindustry3 and as soon'as civil government
and exclusive property have been introduced, they become neceffary
to the existence of the human race. Except in the fingular institu=
tions of Sparta, the wisest legislators have disapproved an agrarian
law as a false and dangerous innovation. rArnong the Romans, the
enormous disproportion of wealth surmounted the ideal restraints of
a doubtful tradition and an obsolete statute; a tradition that the
poorest sollower of Romulus had been endowed with the perpetual
inheritance of two jagercz ¹³¹⁴, a statute which confined the richest-

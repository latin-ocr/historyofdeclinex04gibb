ΤΗΕ DECLINE AND FALL

claim a general illumination for the rccovery of the emperor’s health¹ l
The ferment subfided3 but every accident betrayed the impotence of
the government and the fafflous temper of the people: the guards
were disposed to *mutiny as often as their quarters were changed or
their pay was withheld: the frequent calamities of fires and earth-
quakes afforded the opportunities of disorder; the disputes of the
blues and greens, of the orthodox and heretics‚ degenerated into Χ
bloody battle53 and, in the presence of the Persian ambassador, Jus-
tinian blulhed for himself and for his subjects. Capricious pardon
and arbitrary punishment embittered the irksomeness and discontent
of a long reign: a conspiracy was formed in the palace; and, unless Ι
we are deceived by the names of Marcellus and Sergius, the most l
virtuous arrd the most profligate of the courtiers were associated in '¹ Ι
the same defigns. They had fixed the time of the execution3 their l
rank gave them access to the royal banquet3 and their black ssaves⁶⁵

were stationed in the vestibule and porticos to announce the death a
of the tyram, and to excite a sedition in the capital. But the in· Β
diseretion of an accomplice saved the poor remnant of the days of
Justinian. The conspirators were detected and seized‚ with daggers
hidden under their garments: Marcellus died by his own hand, and
Sergius was dragged from the s311&11ary⁶⁶. Press'ed by remorse‚ or
tempted by the hopes of safety, he accused two officers of the
household of Belisarius3 and toi-ture forced them to declare that they
had acted according to the secret instructions of their patron ⁶⁷.

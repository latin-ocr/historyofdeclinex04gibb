132 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ξιξ P. In the seventh year ofthe reign of Justinian, and about the time of

ffiffif‘the summer solstice, the whole fleet of slX hundred ships was ranged

the stem, in martial pomp before the gai-dens of the palace. The patriarch
suh} 533» pronounced his benedietion, the emperor signified his last commands,
the general’s trumpet gave the signal of departure, and every heart,

’ according to its fears or wishes, explored with anxious curiosity the·
omens of misfortune and success. The first halt was made at Perin-
thus or Heraclea, where Belisarius waited five days to receive some
Thracian horse-s, a military gift of his sovereign. From thence the
fleet pursued their course through the midst of the Propontis; but
as they struggled to pass the streights of the Hellespont, an unfa-
vourable wind detained them four days at Abydus, where the ge-
neral exhibited a memorable leffon of firmness and severity. Two
of the Huns, who in a drunken quarrel had ssain one of their
fellow-soldiers, were instantly shewn to the army suspended on a*
lofty gibbet. The national indignity was resented by their coun-
trymen, who disclaimed the servile laws of the empire, and affertedr
the free privilege of Scythia, where a small fine was allowed to>
expiate the hasty sallies of intemperance and anger. Their com·
plaints were specious, their clamours were loud‚ and the Romans
were not averse to the example of disorder and impunity. But the
rising sedition was appensed by the authority and eloquence of the
general: and he represented to the affembled troops the obligation
of justice, the importance of discipline, the rewards of piety and'
virtue, and the unpardonable guilt of murder, which, in his appre--
henfion‚ was aggravated rather than excused by the vice of intoxi-

cation¹¹. In the navigation from the Hellespont to Peloponnesus,

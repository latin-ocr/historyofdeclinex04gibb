profaned by the worlhippers of fire; addressing them by the en· C Π Α Ρ·

deal-ing appellatione. of sons and brethren, he deplored the public 2--2-—4

and private wrongs of the republic. The subjects of a monem-ch
were persuaded that they fought in the cause of freed0m3 and a

similar enthuliasm was communicated to the foreign mercenaries,
who must have viewed with equal indifference the interest of Rome

and of Persia. Heraclius himself, with the skill and patience of a cen-
turion, inculcated the lessons of the school of tacties, and the soldiers
were affiduoussv trained in the use of their weapons, and the exer-1
cises and evolutions of the field. The cavalry and infantry in light
or heavy armour were divided into two parties 5 the trumpcts were
fixed in the cende, and their signals directed the march, the charge,-
the retreat, or pursuit3 the dire& or oblique order, the deep or
extended phalanx3 to represent in fictitious combat the operatione
of genuine war. whatever hardssup the emperor imposed on the
troops, he inflieoed with equal severity on himself3 their labour‚
their diet, their sseep, were measured by the inflexible rules of dis-
cipline3 and, without despismg the enemy, they were taught to repose
an implicit confidence in their own valour and the wisdom of their
leader. Cilicia was soon encompass'ed with the Perfian arms3 but
their cavalry hefitated to enter the defiles of mount Taurus, till they
were circumvented by the evolutions of Heraclius, who insensibly
gained their rear, whilst he appeared to present his front in order
of battle. By a false motion, which seemed to threaten Armenia, he
drew them, against their wishes, to a general aetion. They were
tempted by the artful disorder of his camp3 but when they advanced

to combat, the ground, the sun, and the expe&ation of both armies,

were unpropitious to the Barbarians3 the Romans successfully re-
peated their ta&iesi11 a field of battle ⁵¹, and the event of the day

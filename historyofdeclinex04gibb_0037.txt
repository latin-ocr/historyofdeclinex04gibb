who already meditated the extirpation of heresy‚ and the conquest
of Italy and Africa. A rigorous lavv which was publishcd at Con-
stantinople, to reduce the Arians by the dread of puniihment within
the pale of the chureh, awakened the just resentment of Theodosio,
{7th claimed for his distreffed brethren of the East, the same indul-
gence which he had so long granted to the CatholIcs of his domi-

nions. At his stern command, the Roman pontiff, with four illzff-
trious senators, embarked on an embaffy, of which he must have

alike dreaded the failure or the success. The singular veneration

shevvn to the first pope who had visited Constantinople was punissied
as a crime by his jealous monarch; the artful or peremptory refusal
of the Byzantine court might excuse an equal‚ and would provoke
a larger, measure of retaliation ; and a mandate was prepared in Italy
to prohibit, after a stated day, the exercise of the Catholic worship. By
the bigotry of his subjeers and enemies, the most tolerant of princes
was driven to the brink of persecution; and the life of Theodoric
was too long, fince he lived to condemn the virtue of Boethius and

⁸⁸ I have laboured to extra& a rational
narrative from the dark, concise, and various
hints of the Valefian Fragment (p. 722, 723,
724), Theophanes (p. ¹45·)‚ Anastaslus (in'

, Johanne‚ p. 35.)‚ and the Hist. Miscella

(P· 103. edit. Muratori). A gentle pressure
and paraphrase of their words, is no vio-
lence. Consult likewise Muratori (Annali
d'Italia, tom⁴ iv. p. ,ηπ-478), with the
Annals and Breviary (tom. i. 239—263.)

⁸⁹ Le Clerc has composed a critical and
philosophical life of Anicius Manlius Seve-
rinus Boetius (Bibliot. Choifle, rom. xvi.
p. 168—275.); and both Tiraboschi (tom.
iii.) and Fabricius (Bibliot. Latin.) may
be usesully consulted. The date of his birth
may be placed about the year 470, and his
death in 524, in a premarure old age (Con-
sol. Phil. Mettica, i. p. 5.).

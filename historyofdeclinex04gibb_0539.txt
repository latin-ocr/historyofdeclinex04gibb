oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Il. The seeds of the saith, which had ssowly arisen in the rocky
and ungrateful soil of Judm, were transplantcd‚ in full maturity, to
the happier elimes of the Gentiles; and the strangers of Rome or
Asia, who never beheld the manhood‚ were the more readily dis.
posed to embrace the divinity, of Christ. The polytheist and the
philosopher, the Greek and the Barbarian‚ were alike accustomed
to conceive a long succeffion, an infinite chain of angels or daemons,
or deities, or aeons, or emanafions, iffuing from the throne of light.
Nor could it seem strange 01· incredible‚ that the first of these aeons,
the Logos, or word of God, of the same substance with the Father,
ssiould descend upon carth, to deliver the human race from vice and
error, and to conda& thern in the paths of life and immortality.
But the prevailing doeh-ine of the eternity and inherent pravity os
matter, infected the primitive churches of the East. Many among
the Gentile proselytes‚ refused to believe that a caelestial spirit, an
undivided portion of the first effence, had been personally united
with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh: and, in their zeal
for the divinity, they pioussy abjured the humanity, of Christ.
While his blood was still recent on mount Calvarym, the Docetes‚ a
numerous and learned se& of Afiatics, invented the phantqstic system,

which was afterwards propagated by the Marcionites, the Mani-
chaeans, and the various names of the Gnostic heresy¹‘. They de-

nied the truth and authenticity of the gospeIS, as far as they relate
the conception of Mary, the birth of Christ, and the thirty years

358 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ΕΛΘ. Ρ· proaches of impiety and avarice have stained the virtues or the re·-

ι--ν--θ putation of Tribonian. In a bigotted and persecuting court, the
principal minister was accused of a secret averfion to the Christian
saith, and was supposed to entertain the sentiments of an Atheist and
a Pagan, which have been imputed‚ inconsistently enough, to the last
philosophers of Greece. His avarice was more clearly proved and
more senfibly felt. If he were swayed by gifts in the administra-
tion of justice, the example of Bacon will again occur3 nor can
the merit of Tribonian atone for his basenes5‚ if he degraded the
san&ity of his profession3 and if laws were every day ena&ed,
modified, or repealed, for the base consideration of his private emo-
lument. In the sedition of Constantinople‚ his removal was granted
to the clamours, perhaps to the just indignation, of the people : but
the quaestor was speedily restored, and, till the hour of his death,
he possessed, above twenty years, the favour and confidence of the
emperor. His paffive and dutisul submiffion has been honoured
with the praise of Justinian himself, whose vanity was incapable of
discerning how often that submiffion degenerated into the groffest
adulation. Tribonian adored the virtues of his gracious master: the
earth was unworthy of such a prince3 and he asscited a pious fear,
that Justinian‚ like Elijah or Romulus, would be snatched into the
air, and transsated alive to the mansions of coelestial glory ⁷⁴.

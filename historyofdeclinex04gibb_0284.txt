provinces of Lucania, Apulia, and Calabria, submitted to the king
of the Goths. Totila led his army to the gates of Rome, pitched
his camp at Tibur, or Tivoli, within twenty miles of the capital,
and calmly exhorted the senate and people to compare the tyranny
of the Greeks with the blessings of the Gothic reign.

The rapid success of Totila may be partly ascribed to the revolu-

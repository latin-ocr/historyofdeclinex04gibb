permanent dominion from the foot of the Alps to the sea-coast of

The reign of Baian is⁸ the brightest aera of their mo-

narchy3 their chagan, who occupied the rustic palace of Attila,

appears to have imitated his character and policy ²³3 but as the same

scenes were repeated in a smaller circle, a minute representation of

the copy would be devoid of ‘the greatness and novelty of the original.
The pride of the second Justin, of Tiberius, and l'vlaurice, was

²² The whole series of the tyranny of Hor-
mouz, the revoltof Babram, and the flight
and restoration of Chosroes, is related by two
contemporary Greeks—more concisely by
Evagrius (1.vi. c.16,17‚ 18‚19.)—and most
diffusely by TheophylaCt simocatta (l. iii.
c. 6—18. 1. iv. c. 1-15. 1. ν. c.1—-15.):
succeeding compilers‚ Zonaras and Cedrenus,

tisular memoirs. The great Persian histo-

²³ A general idea of the pride and power
of the chagan may be taken from Menander
(Excerpt. Legat. p. ¹¹72 &c ) and Theophy-
la& (l. i. c. 3. 1. vii. c. ¹5¹)r whose eight
books are much rnore honourable to the A-
var than to the Roman prince. The prede-
cesl'ors of Baian had tasted the libemlity of
Rome, and he survived the reign of Maurice

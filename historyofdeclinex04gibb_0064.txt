senator, or even a citizen, conseious of his dignity, would have
blushed to expose his person or his horses in the circus of Rome.
The games were exhibited at the expence of the republic, the ma-
gistrates, or the emperors: but the reins were abandoned to servile
hands, and if the profits of a favourite charioteer sometimes ex-

of popular extravagance, and the high wages of a disgraceful profes·
slon. The race, in its first institution, was a simple contest of two
chariots, whose drivers were distinguished by while and red liveries ς
two additional colours, a light green, and a caerulean blue, were
afterwards introduced3 and, as the races were repeated twenty-five
times, one hundred chariots contributed iu the same day to the>
pomp of the circus. The four fizfflons soon acquired a legal esta-
blishment, and a mysterious origin, and their fanciful colours were
derived from the various appearances of nature in the four seasons

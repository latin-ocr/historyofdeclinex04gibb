juries, benefits, and promises3 and the interpretation of voluntary κ-,Ὓ--ι

conti-acts and testaments, which are often diciated by fraud ‘or ig-
norance, affords a long and laborious exercise to the sagacity of the
judge. The business of life is multiplied by the extent of commeree
and dominion, and the residence of the parties in the distant pro-

” ’ vinces of an empire, is productive of doubt, delay, and inevitable

’ appeals from the local to the supreme magistrate. Justinian, the

Greek emperor of Constantinople and the East‚ was the legal suc-
cessor of the Latian shepherd who had planted a colony on the banks
of the Tyber. In a period of thirteen hundred years, the laws had

, τεὶυὲὶαῐιῖίγ followed the changes of government and manum-35 and

the laudable delire of conciliating ancient names with recent inssi-
tutions‚ destroyed the harmony‚ and swelled the magnitude of the
obscure and irregular system. The laws which excuse on any oc-
caslons the ignorance of their subjedts, confess their own impersev-

tion83 the civil jurisprudence, as it was abridged by Juffinian, still

continued a mysterious science and a profitable‘ trade, and the in-
nate perplexity of the study was involved in tenfold darkness by
the private industry of the praetitioners. The expence of the pur·
suit sometimes exceeded the value of the prize, and the fairest right&
were abandoned by the poverty or prudence of the claimants. Such
costly justice might tend to abate the spirit of litigation, but the un-
equal pressure serves only to encrease the influence of the rich, and
to aggravate the misery of the poor. By these dilatory and expen-
five proceedings, the wealthy pleader obtains a more certain ad-
vantage than he could hope from the accidental corruption os his
judge. The experience of an abuse‚ from which our own age and
country are not perfeffly exempt, may sometimes provoke a gene-
rous indignation, and extort the hasty wish of exchanging our ela-
borate jurisprudence for the simple and summary decrees of a Turkilh

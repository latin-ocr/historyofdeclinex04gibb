earthquake3 but the queen of the East, the new Theopolis, had
been raised *from the ground by the liberality of Justinian3 and the·
increasmg greatness of the buildings and the people already erased
the memory of this recent disaster. On one fide, the city was de-
fended by the mountain, on the other by the river Orontes ; but the
most acceffible part was commanded by a superior eminence: the
proper remedies were reje&ed‚ from the despicable fear of discover-
ing its weakness to the enemy ; and Germanus, the emperor-'s ne-
phew, refused to trust his person and dignity within the walls of a
besieged city. The people of Antioch had inherited the vain and
satirical genius of their ancestors: they were elated by a sudden re-
inforcement of fix thousand soldiers; they disdained the offers of an
’ easy capitulation3 and their intemperate clamours insulted from the
ramparts the majesty of the great king. Under his eye the Persian
myriads mounted with scaling-ladders to the affault3 the Roman
me'rcenaries fled through the opposite gate of Daphne ; and the ge-
nerous refistanee of the youth of Antioch served only to aggravato
the miseries of their country. As Chosroes, attended by the am=
baffadors of Justinian, was descending from the mountain, he affe&-
ed, in a plaintive voice, to deplore the obstinacy and ruin of thar
unhappy people ; but the ssaughter still raged with unrelenting furyg
and the city, at the command of a Earbarian, was delivered to the
flames, The cathedral of Antioch was indeed preserved by the ava-
rice, not the piety, of the conqueror: a more honourable exemption
was granted to the church of St. Julian, and the quar-ter of the
town where the ambassadors refided 3 some distant streets were saved
by the ssrifting of the wind, and the walls still subfisted to„ protecfir,

and soon to betray, their new inhabitants. Fanaticism had defaced.

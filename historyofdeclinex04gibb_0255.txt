whose maritime coast extends about two hundred miles, from the tffiffla

neighbourhood of Trebizond to Dioscurias, and the confines of Cir-
caffia. Both the soil and climate are relaxed by exceffive moisture :
twenty-eight rivers, besldes the Phafis and his dependent streaxns,
convey their waters to the sea3 and the hollowness of the ground
appears to iudicate the subterraneous channels between the Euxine
and the Caspian. In the fields where wheat or barley is sown, the
earth is too soft to sustain the action of the plough ; but the gom, a
small grain, not unlike the millet or coriander seed, supplies the or·
dinary food of the people ; and the use of bread is confined to the
prince and his nobles. Yet the vintage is more plentiful than the
harvest3 and the bulk of the stems, as well as the quality of the
vwine, display the unaffisted powers of nature. The same powers
continually tend to overshadow the face of the country with thick
forests ; the timber of the hilis, and the flax of the plains‚ contribute
to the abundance of naval stores; the wild and tame animals, the
horse, the ox, and the hog, are remarkably prolific, -and the name
of the pheasant is expreffive of his native habitation on the banks
of the Phafis. The gold mines to the south of Trebizond‚ which
are still worked with sufficient profit, were a subject of national dis-
pute between Justinian' and Chosroes3 and it is not unreasonable
to believe, that a vein of precious metal may be equally diffused
through the circle of the hills‚ although these secret treasures are

the impotence of the laws. VI. The testament of Euhium, count
of the domestice, declared the emperor his sole heir, on condition,
however, that he should discharge his debts and leg-acies, allow to his
three daughters a decent maintenance, and bestow each of them in
marriage, with a portion of ten pounds of gold. But the splendid
fortune of Eulalius had been consumed by fire3 and the inventory
of his goods did not exceed the trifling sum of five hundred and
fixty-four pieces of gold.' A similar instance, in Grecian history,

imitation. He checked the selfilh murmurs of the treafiuy, ap-

plauded the confidence* of his friend, discharged the legacies and
debts, educated the three virgins under the eye of the empress Theo-
dora, and doubled the marriage portion which had satisfied the ten-
derness of their sather⁸⁹. The humanity of a priuce (for princes
cannot be generous) is entitled to some praise ; yet even in this a&

legal or natural* heirs, which Procopius imputes to the reign of justi-2⁷

of soliciting or extorting or suppoling testament3‚ was beneficinlly
pradilised by the agents of the palace. This base and mischievousr
tyranny invades the security of private life 3 and the monarch who

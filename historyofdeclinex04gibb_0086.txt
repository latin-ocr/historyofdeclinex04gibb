THE DECLINE AND FALL

nicipal revenues which had been appropriated to these useful insti-
tutions. Even the soldiersrwere injured3 and such was the decay
of military spirit, that they were injured with impunity. The em-
peror refused, at the return of each fifth year, the customary dona-
tive of five pieces of gold, reduced his veterans to beg their bread,
and suffered unpaid armies to melt away in the wars of Italy and
Persia. II. The humanity of his predeceffors had always remitteti,
in some auspicious circumstance of their reign, the arrears of the
public tribute; and they dextroussy assumed the merit of refigning
those claims which it was imprad'ticable to enforce. “ Justinian, in
“ the space of thirty-two years, has never granted a similar indul-

“ roads, Anastasius promised a, general exemption of seven years:
“ the province?¹ of Justinian have been ravaged by the Perfians and

“ which were adlually taken by the enemy.” Such is the language
of the secret historiam, who expressly denies that any indulgence
was granted to Palestine after the revolt of the Samaritans 3 a false
and odious charge, confuted hythe authentic record, which attests
a relief of thirteen centenaries of gold (fifty-two thousand pounds)
obtained for that desolate province by the interceffion of St. Sabas ⁸⁵.

ation, which fell like a hail-storin upon the land, like a devouring
pestilence on its inhabitants ε but we ssmuld become the accomplices

of his malignity, if we imputed to Justinian alone the ancient though

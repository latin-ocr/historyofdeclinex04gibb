C H A P. “ in return for a gift which you no longer poffess; he presents you
high—a “ with an ancient province of the empire 3 he refigns to the Goths
“ the sovereignty of the British issand.'' Belisarius reje&ed with
equal firmness and contempt, the offer of a tribute 3 but he allowed
the Gothic ambaffadors to seek their fate from the mouth of Justi-
nian himself ; and consented, with seeming refflCtance, to a truce of
three months, from the winter solstice to the equinox of spring.
Prudenee might not safely trust either the oaths or hostages of the
Barbarians, but the conscious superiority of the Roman chief was
Belisarius re· expreffed in the distribution of his troops. As soon as fear or
ξῗᾶξζξςῗξῖἶ hunger compelled the Goths to evacuate Alba, Porto, aud Centum-
cellae, their place was instantly supplied ; the garrisons of Narni‚
Spoleto, and Perusla, were reinforced, and the seven camps of the
befiegers were gradually encompass‘ed with the calamities of a siege.
The prayers and pilgrimage of Datius, biss10p of Milan, were not
without effe&; and he obtained one thousand Thracians and Isau-
rians, to affist the revolt of Liguria against her Arian tyrant. At
the same time, John the Sanguinary⁹⁴‚ the nephew of Vitalian‚ was
detached with two thousand chosen horse, first to Alba on the Fucine
lake, and afterwards to the frontiers of Picenum on the Hadriatie
sea. “ In that province‚” said Belisarius, ‘⁶ the Goths have de-
“ pofited their families and mensures, without a guard or the suspi- ι.
“ cion of danger. Doubtless‚ they will violate the truce: let them J
“ feel your presence, before they hear of your motions. Spare the l
“ Italians; suffer not any fortified places to remain hostile in your
“ rear; and faithfully reserve the spoil for an equal and common
“ partition. lt would not be reasonable? he added with a laugh,
‘⁶ that whilst we are toiling to the destruction of the drones, our
“ more fortunate brethrcn should rifle and enjoy the honey.''

{hould agree with the civilians, if the civilians agreed among them-
selves. But pofitive institutions are often the result of custom and
prejudice3 laws and language are ambiguous and arbitrary; where

and his stern though harmless opposition to the tyrant of Rome.
Their legal studies were influenced by the various colours of their

temper and principles. Labeo was attached to the form of the old

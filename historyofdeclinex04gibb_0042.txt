Cxigx‘ixi' senate* was condemned as criminal by the trembling voices of the
bqr—e senators themselve53 and their ingratitude deserved the with or
predi&ion of Boethius, that, after 111111, none should be found'guilty

of the same offence ⁹⁷.

ξέξηξὲὲῗῐζῃᾶ While Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment
‹Xagnsu the sentence or the stroke of death, he composed in the tower of

Pavia the corffolation ffpffis‘stphyi a golden volume not unworthy

without confining his definition to the precise period of ωεΙνο or z-—w-..a
fourteen yeais⁶. This opposition of sentiments vas propagated ln
the writings and less'ons of the two founders; the schools of Capito
and Labeo maintained their inveterate conflie‘c from the age of
Augustus to that of Hadrian‘'⁶; and the two seets derived their ap-
pellations from Sabinus and Proculius, their most celebrated teachers.
The names of Cqffians and Pegastrms were likewise applied to the
same parties; but, by a strange reverse, the popular cause was in the
hands of Pegasus ⁵⁷, a timid ssave of Domitian, while the favourite
of the Caesars was represented by Caffius⁶⁸‚ who gloi⁴Ied in his de-
scent from the patriot affaflin. By the perpetual edict, the contro-
versles of the sects were in a great measure determined. For that
important work, the emperor Hadrian preferred the chief of the
Sabinians: the friends of monarchy prevailed3 but the moderation
of Salvius Julian insensibly reconciled the viCtors and the van-
quished. Like the contemporary philosophers‚ the lawyers of the

age of the Antonines disclaimed the authority of a master, and

⁶ justinian (Institut. l. iii. tit. xxiii. and is the age—msam 5501- μ ww σς xus:

Theophil. Vers. Graec. p. 677. 680.) has

1 commemorated this weighty dispute, and the

verses of Homer that were alleged on either
fide as legal authorities. It was decided by
Paul (leg. 33. ad Edi& in Pandest. l. xviii.
tit. i. leg. 1.), since, in a simple exchange,
the buyer could not be discriminated from the
seller.

⁶⁵ This controversy was likewise given for
the procubans, to supersede the indecency of
a search, and to comply with the aphorism
of Hippocrates, who was attached to the sep-
tenary number of two weeks of years, or 700
of days (Institut. 1. 1. tit. xxii.). Plutarch
and the stoics (de Placit.Philosoph. l. v. c. 24.)
affign a more natural reason. F ourteen years

are described by Mascou (c. ii-vii. p. 24—-
120.), and it would be almost ridiculous to
praise his equal justice to these obsolete sec'ts.

styles the praese& or bailff of Rome sanetis-
fimus legum interpres. From his science,
says the old scholiam he was called, not a
man, but a book. He derived the singular
name of Pegasus from the galley which his
father commanded.

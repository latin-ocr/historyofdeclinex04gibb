242 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {glas} Ρ· campaigns, to the obedience of justinian. Unpraecised in the art of
u--v--t violating treaties, he secretly excited his bold and subtle vaffal Almon-

dar. That prince of the Saracens, who refided at Hira⁵⁹, had not been
included in the general peace, and still waged an obscure war against
his rival Arethas‚ the chief of the tribe of Gaffan, and confederate
of the empire. The subject of their dispute was an extensive sheep-
walk in the desert to the south of Palmyra. An immemorial tribute
for the licence of pasture, appeared to attest the rights of Almondar‚
while the Gaffanite appeal'ed to the Latin name of strata, a paved
mad, as an unquestionable evidence of the sovereignty and labours
of the Romans⁶⁰. The two monarchs snpported the cause of their
respee'tive vaffal's ; and the Persian Arab, without expeffmg the event
of a ssow and doubtful arbitration, enriched his flying camp with
the spoil and captives of Syria. Instead of repelling the arms,
Justinian attempted to seduce the fidelity, of Almondar, while he
called from the extremities of the earth, the nations of AEthiopia
and Scythia to invade the dominions of his rival. But the aid of
such allies was distant and precarious, and the discovery of this
hostile correspondence justified the complaints of the Goths and
Armeniam, who implored, almost at the same time, the proteffion
of Chosroes. The descendants of Arsaces, who were still numerous

in Armenia, had been provoked to affert the last relies of national
freedom and hereditary rank; and the ambaffadors of Vitiges had

secretl'y traversed the empire to expose the instant, and almost inevi-
table danger of the kingdom of Italy. Their representations were
uniform, weighty‚ and effeetual. “ We stand before your throne„

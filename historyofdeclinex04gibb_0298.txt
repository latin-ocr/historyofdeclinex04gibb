THE DECLINE AND FALL

the ssave of his wife3 but the servitude of habit and affee'tion be-
came less disgraeeful when the death of Theodora had removed the

bafer influence of fear. Joannina their daughter, and the sole heiress ⁵ ξ ι
,of their fortunes, was 'betrothed to Anastafius the grandson, or rather ⁵²

the nephew, of the empress²¹, whose kind interpofition forwarded ,·

the consummation of their youthful loves. But the power of Theo-
›dora expired, the parents of Joanhina returned, and her honour,
perhaps her happiness, were sacrificed to the revenge of an un-
feeling mother, who diffolved the imperfe& nuptials before they
had been ratified by the ceremonies of the church²².

Before the departure of Belisarius, Perufia was befieged, and few
cities were impregnable to the Gothic arms. Ravenna, Ancona, and
Crotona, still refisted the Barbarians3 and when Totila asked in mar-

riage one of the daughters of France, he was stung by the just re- ‚

proach that the king of Italy was unworthy of his title till it was

- acknowledged by the Roman people. Three thousand of the bravest

soldiers had been left to defend the capital. On the suspicion of a
monopoly, they maffacred the governor, and announced to Justi-
nian, by a deputation of the clergy, that unless their offence was

pardoned, and their arrears were satisfied‚ they should instantly ac- f·

cept the tempting offers of Totila. But the officer who succeeded

²¹ Alemannus (ad Hist. Arcanam, p. 68.),
Ducange (Familiae Byzant. p. 98.)‚ and Hei·
neccius (Hist. Juris Civilis, p. 434.)‚ all three
represent Anastafius as the son of the daughter
of Theodora; and their opinion firmly reposes
on the enambiguous testimony of Procopius
(Anecdot. c. 4, 5.—Gwyzr‚sl‘p twite repeated).
And yet 1 will remark, 1. That, in the year
547, Theodora could scarcely hare a grand—
son of the age os puberty3 2. That we are
totally ignorant of this daughter and her
husban‹l; and, 3. That Theodora concealed
her bastards, and that her grandson by Justi-

nian would have been heir-apparent of the Tr

OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Gothic prince and the Roman general, alike ignorant of their de- C H Α Ρ,

figas, solicited‚ with hope and terror, the friendlhip of these danger..
ous allies. Till he had secured the pais-age of the Po on the bridge
of Paviav, the grandson of Clovis diffembled his intentions, which he
at length declared, by affauhing, almost at the sume instant, the

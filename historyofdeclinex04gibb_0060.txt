Her tyran ny.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

The Eastern world fell prostrate before the genius and fortune of
the daughter of Aeacius. The prostitute who, in the presence of
innumerable spectators, had polluted the theatre of Constantinople,
was adorcd as a queen in the same city, by grave magistrates, ortho-
dox bishops, victorious generals, and captive monarchs³⁹.

Those who believe that the female mind is totally depraved by the
loss of chastity, will eagerly listen to all the invediives of private
envy or popular resentment‚ which have diffembled the virtues of
Theodora, exaggerated her vices, and condemned with rigour the
venal or voluntary sins of the youthful harlot. From a motive
of shame or contempt, she often declined the servile homage of
the multitude, escaped from the odious light of the capital, and
passed the greatest part of the year in the palaces and gardent: which
vvere pleasantly seated on the sea-coast of the Propontis and the
Bosphorus. Her private hours were devoted to the prudent as well
aa grateful care of her beauty, the luxury of the bath and table,
and the long ssumber of the evening and the morning. Her secret
apartments were occupied by the favourite women and eunuchs‚
whose interests and paffions she indulged at the expence of justice;
the most illustrious personages of the state were crowded into a dark
and sultry antichamber, and when at last, after tedious attendance,
they were admitted to kiss the feet of Theodora, they experienced,
as her humour might suggest, the silent arrogance of an empress, or
the capricious levity of a comedian. Her rapacious avarice to ac·-
cumulate an immense treasure, may be excused by the apprehenfion
of her husband's death, which could leave no alternative between

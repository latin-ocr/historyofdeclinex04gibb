the shades of Tibur and Praeneste, the Roman senators still retii-ed in
the winter—season to the warm sun, and salubrious springs of 13³3ae ;
and their villas, which advanced on solid moles into the bay of
Naples, commanded the various prospe& of the sky, the earth,
and the water. On the eastern fide of the Hadriane, a new Cam-
pania was formed in the fair and fruitful province of Istria‚ which
communicated with the palace of Ravenna by an easy navigation of
one hundred miles. The rich produffl0ns of Lucania and the ad-
jacent provinces were exchanged at the Marcilian fountain, rin a
populous fair annually dedicated to trade, intemperance‚ and super-
stition. In the solitude of Comum, which had once been animated
by the mild genius of Pliny, a transparent bason above sixty miles
in length still reflecsted the rural scats which encompaffed the margin
of the Larian lake ; ancl the gradual ascent of the hills was covered
by a triple plantation of olives of vines and of chesnutt1·ees⁷². Agri-
culture revived under the shadow of peace, and the number of hus-
bandmen was multiplied by the redemption of captives⁷³. The
iron mines of Dalmatia, a gold mine in Bruttium, were carefully
explored‚ and the Pomptine marshes, as well as those of Spolet0‚
were drained and cultivated by private undertakers, whose distant
reward must depend on the continuanee of the public prosperity⁷⁴.

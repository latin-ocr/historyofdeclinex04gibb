sand sesterces ς and an only daughter was condemned almost as an
alien in her father's house. The zeal of friendssrsp, and parentttl asi-
feffion, suggested a liberal artifice: a qualilied citizen was named
in the testament‚ with a prayer or injurietion that he would restore
the inheritance to the person for whom it was truly intended. Va-
rious was the conduec of -the trustees in this painfnl situation : they
had sworn to observe the laws of their country, but· honour
prompted them to violate their oath: and if they preferred their
interest under the mast< of patriotism‚ they forfeited the esteem of
every virtnous mind. The declaration of Augustus relieved their
doubts, gave a legal fannion to confidential testaments and codicils,
and gently unravelled the forms and restraints of the republican
jurisprudence¹⁵⁶. But as the new praefice of trusts degenerated into
some abuse, the trustee was enabled, by the Trebellian and Pegasian
decrees, to reserve one fourth of the estate, or to transfer on the
head of the real heir all the debts and aetions of the sncceffion.
The interpretation of testaments was stri& and literal; but the lan-
guage of trzsts and codicils was delivered from the minute and
technical accuracy of the civilians¹⁵⁷.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

A fanatic monk ran through

κ--ν--θ the streets with a drawn sword, denouncing against him the wrath

and the sentence of God, and a vile plebeiam, who represented his
countenance and apparel, was seated on an ass, and pursued by the
imprecations of the multitude ⁴³. The emperor suspected the popu-
larity of Germanus with the soldiers and citizens; he feared, he
threatened, but he delayed to strike 3 the patrician fled to the sanc-
tuary of the church ; the people rose in his defence, the walls were
deserted by the guards, and the lavvless city was abandoned to the
flames and rapine of a nocturnal tumult. In a small bark, the un-
fortunate Maurice, with his wife and nine children, escaped to the Δ
Afiatic ffiore, but the violence of the wind compelled him to land
at the church of St. Autonomus⁴⁴ near Chalcedon, from whence he
dispatched Theodosius, his eldest son, to implore the gratitude and
friendship of the Perfian monareh. For himself, he refused to fly:
his body *was tortured with sciatic pains⁴⁵, his mind was enfeebled
by superstition 3 he patiently awaited the event of the revolution,
and addreffed a fervent and public prayer to the Almighty, that the
punissrment of his sins might be inflieted in this world, rather than
in a future life. After the abdication of Maurice, the two factions

disputed the choice of an emperor ; but the favourite of the blues

⁴³ In their clamours against Maurice, the

scribed by Gyllius (de Bosphoro Thracio,
people of Constantinople bmnded him with

1. iii. c. xi.) as one of the two harbours of

the name of Marcionite or Marcionist: a he-
sesy (says Theophylaft, l. viii. c. 9.) μετα,
τινος μωρας ευλαβειας, ευκθης τε και uara-ymaro<-
Did they only cast out a vague reproach-or
had the emperor really listened to forne ob-
scure reacher of those ancient Gnostics ?

4⁴ The church of St. Autonomus (whom I
have not the honour to know) was ¹30 stadia
from Constantinople (Theophylaa, 1. viii.
c. 9,). The portos Eutropius, where Mau-
rice and his children were murdered, is de-

Chalcedon.

4⁵ The inhabitants of Constantinople were
generally subject to the nosos oef0f=ff⁴3=÷3 and
Theophylaft infinuates (l. viii. c. 9.), that if
it were consistent with the rules of history, he
could affign the medical cause. Yet such a
digression would not have been more imper·
tinent than his enquiry (l. vii. e. 16, 17.) into
the annual inundations of the Nile, and all

the opinions of the Greek philosopher-s on
that subject.

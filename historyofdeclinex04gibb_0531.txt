OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

example of Augustus, their care of the national dignity was ccle-
brated hythe poets of the times, but the decay of genius may be
measured by the distance between Horace and Geor-ge os Pisidia:-
.the subjeets and brethren of Heraclius were redeemed from perse-
cution‚ ssavery, and exile3 but, instead of the Roman eagles‚ the
true Wood of the holy cross was restored to the importunate demands
of the successor of Constantine. The victor was not ambitione of
enlarging the weakness of the empire5 the son of Chosrocs aban-
donecl without regret the conquests of his father5 the Persums who
evacuated the cities of Syria and Egypt were honourably conducted
to the frontier, and a war which had wounded the vitals of the
two monarchies, produced no change in their external and relative
situation. The return of Heraclius from Tauris to Constantinoplc,
was a perpetual triumph3 and after the exploits of six glorious
campaigns, he peaceably enjoyed the sabbath of his toils. After a
long impatience, the senate, the clergy‚ and the people‚ went forth
to meet their hero, with tears and acclamations, with olive branches
and innumerable lamps: he entered the capital in a chariot drawn
by four elephant35 and as soon as the emperor could disengage him-
self from the tumult of public joy, he tasted more genuine satisfac-
tion in the embraces of his mother and his son ¹¹⁰.

The succeeding year was illustrated by a triumph of a very differ-
ent kind, the restitution of the true cross to the holy sepulchre.
Heraclius performed in person the pilgrimage of Jerusalem, the iden-
tity of the relick was verified by the discreet patriarch¹¹¹‚ and this

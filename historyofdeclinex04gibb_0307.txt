the succours had arrived, he retired to his tent, affinned the dress
and arms of a private soldier, and gave the signal of battle. The
first line of cavalry advanced with more courage than discretion‚
and left behind them the infantry of the second line, They were
soon engaged between the horns of a crescent, into which t-he ad-

their distmss, drove them forwards to a close and unequal conflicL
in which they could only use their lances against an enemy equally
{killed in all the instruments of war. A generous emulation inspired
the Romans and their Barbarian allies; and Narses, who calmly
viewed and directed their efforts, doubted to whom he should ad-

Goths were ssaughtered, without mercy, in the field of Tagina.

were not satisfied of their victory, till they beheld the corpse of the
Gothic king. His hat, enriched with geme, and his bloody robe,
Δ were presented to Justinian· by the mefi'engers of triumph ³⁷,

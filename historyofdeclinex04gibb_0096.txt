foreseen the glory of the new temple, which at the end of forty
days was strenuoussy undertaken by the piety of Justinian¹⁰³. The
ruins were cleared away, a more spacious plan was described, and
as it required the consent of some proprietors of ground, they ob-
tained the most exorbitant terms from the eager defires and timorous
conscience of the monarch. Anthemius formed the defign, and
his genius directed the hands of ten thousand workmen, whose pay-
ment in pieces of fine silver was never delayed beyond the evening.
The emperor· himself, clad in a linen tunic, surveyed each day
their rapid progress, and encouraged their diligence by his famili-
arity, his zeal, and his rewards. The new cathedral of St. Sophia
was consecrated by the patriarch, five years, eleven months, and ten
days from the first foundation; and in the midst of the solemn
festival, Justinian exclaimed with devout vanity, “ Glory be to God,
“ who hath thought me worthy to accomplish so great a work3 I
“ have vanquilhed thee, O Solomon¹⁰⁴!'' But the pride of the Roman

Solomon, before twenty years had elapsed, was humbled by an

(de Edific. l. i. e.1.), Agathias (l. ν. p. 152,

(de Origin. C. P. p. 64m74.)‚ and the ano-

tom. i. l. iv. p. 65—80.). 3. The great
Byzantine antiquarium, Ducange (Comme-nt.

Christ. l. iii. p. 5—-78 ). 4. Two French
travellers—the one, Peter Gyllius (de Topo-

the other, Grelot (Voyage de C. Ρ. p. 93—

scale, appear more corre& than those of
Ducange. I have adopted and reduced the
measures of Grelot: but as no Christian can
now ascend the dome, the height is horrow-
ed from Evagrius, compared with Gyllius,
Goeaves, and the Oriental Geographer.

¹⁰⁴ Solomon’s temple was surrounded with
courts‚porticos‚ &c. ς but the proper struaure
of the house of God was no more (if we take
the Egyptian or Hebrew cubit at 22 inches)
than 55 feet in height, 36} in breadth‚ and
110 in length—a small parilh church, says
Prideaux (Conneslion, vol. i. p. 144. folio);
but few snnffluaries could be valued at four
or five millions sterling!

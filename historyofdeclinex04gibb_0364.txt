From the library of Tribonian‚ they chose forty, the most eminent

civilians of former times ⁷⁶: two thousand treatises were comprised

in an abridgment of fifty books3 and it has been carefully recorded,
:that three millions of lines or sentences⁷⁷, were reduced, in this ab-
strad’t, to the moderate number of one hundred and fifty thousand.
The edition of this great work was delayed a mouth after that of the

1NST1TUTES3 and it seemed reasonable that the elements should
precede the digest of the Roman law. As soon as the emperor had
approved their labours, he ratified‚ by his legissative power, the spe-
culations of these private citizens: their commentaries‚ on the twelve
tables, the perpetual edict, the laws of the people‚.and the decrees
of the senate, succeeded to the authority of the text3 and the text
was abandoned, as an useless, though venerable, relic of antiquity.
The Codc, the Pandeffi‘s, and the Institutas, were declared to be the

⁷⁷ The Στιχω of the ancient MSS. may be
striffly defined as sentences or periods of a
complete sense, which, on the breadth of the
parchment rolls or volumes, composed as
many lines of unt-qual length. The num—

on the errors of the scribes (Ludewig‚ p. 21 ι

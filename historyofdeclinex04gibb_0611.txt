OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 609

mal war3 the lands between Tauris and Erivan were dispeopled by C H ,Α P.
the cruel policy of the Sophies; and myriads of Christian families ἓξ
were transplanted, to perish or to propagate in the distant provinces
of Perfia. Under the rod of oppression, the zeal of the Armenians
is fervent and intrepid: they have often preferred the crown os
martyrdom to the white turban of Mahomet3 they devoutly hate
the error and idolatry of the Greeks ; and their translent union with
the Latins is not less devoid of truth, than the thousand bishops
whom their patriarch offered at the fect of the Roman pontiff¹⁴².
The catholic or patriarch of the Armenians resides in the monastery
of Ekmiafin, three leagues from Erivan. Forty-seven archbissiops,
each of whom may claim the obedience of four or five suffragans,
are consecrated by his hand 3 but the far greater part are only titular
prelates, who dignify with their presence and service the simplicity
of his court. As soon as they have performed the lsturgy, they
cultivate the garden3 and our bishops will hear with surprise, that

. the austerity of their life encreases in just proportion to the elevation
of their rank. In the fourscore thousand towns or villages of his

spiritual empire, the patn'arch receives a small and voluntary tax
from each person above the age of fifteen; but the annual amount
of fix hundred thousand crowns is insufficient to supply the inceffant
demands of charity and tribute. Since the beginning of the last cen-
tury, the Armenians have obtained a large and lucrative share of the
commerce of the East: in their return from Europe, the caravan
usually halts in the neighbourhood of Erivan, the altars are enriched
with the fruits of their patient industry; and the faith of Eutyches is

preached in their recent congregations of Barbary and Poland¹⁴'.

220 THEDECLINE AND FALL

C H A Ρ· incessant rapine of their neighbours compelled them to bury this
a& treasure in the earth; but on the appearance of a stranger, it was
freely imparted by a people, whose unfavourable charaCter is qua-
lified by the epithets of chaste, patient, and hospitable. As their
supreme god, they adored an invisible master of the thunder. The

rivers and the nymphe obtained their subordinate honours, and the·

popular worship was expressed in vows and sacrifice. The Sclavo- , Ι ι

nians disdained to obey a despot, a prince, or even a magistrate ς
but their experience was too narrow, their paffions too headstrong‚
to compose a system of equal law or general defence. Some volun-
tary respe& was yielded to age and valour3 but each tribe or village
existed as a separate republic, and all must be persuaded where none
could be compelled. They fought on foot, almost naked‚ and, ex-
cept an unwieldy ffiield, without any defenfive armour: their wea-
pons of offence were a bow, a quiver of small poisoned arrows,
and a long rope, which they dextroussy- threw from a distance, and.
entangled their enemy in a running noose. In the field, the Scla-
vonian infantry was dangerous by their speed, agility, and hardi-
ness: they swam, they dived, they remained under water, drawing
their breath through a hollow cane; and a river or lake was often
the scene of their unsuspeeced ambuscade. But these were the at-
chievements of spies or stragglers; the military arts was unknown
to the Sclavonians; their name was obscure, and their conquesta·
' were inglorious¹⁵. ’

THE DECLINE AND FALL

of Naples, which were dividcd by hostile lands from the palace· oi?
Ravenna, acknowledged‚ both in peace and war, the supremacy of ’
the exarch. The dutchy of Rome appears to have included the
Tuscan, Sabine, and Latian conquests, of the first four hundred
years of the city, and the limits may be distinffly traced along the
coast, from Civita Vecchia, to Terracina, and with the course of·
the'Tyber from Ameria and Narni to the port of Ostia. The nu-·
merous issands from Grado to Chiozza, composed the infant domi-
nion of Venice3 but the more acceffible towns on the continent
were overthrown by the Lonibards, who beheld with impotent fury
a new capital rising from the waves. The power of the dukes of
Naples was circumscribed by the bay and the adjacent isses, by the
hostile territory of Capua, and by the Roman colony of Amalphi ³⁵,
whose industn‘ous citizens, by the invention of the mariner’s com*
pass, have unveiled the face of the globe. The three issands of
Sardinia, Corfica, and Sicily, still adhered to the empire3 and the*
acquifition of the farther Calabria removed the land-mark of Autharis
from ‘the ssmre o'f Rhegium to the isthmus of Consentia. In Sar-
dinia, the savage mountaineers preserved the liberty and religion·
of their ancestors3 but the husbandmen of Sicily were chained ter
their rich and cultivated soil. Rome was oppreffed by the iton*
sceptre of the exarche, and a Greek, perhaps an eunuch, insulted

„ with impunity the ruins of the Capitol. But Naples soon acquired ¹ Α

the privilege of electing her own dukes³⁶3 the independence of
Amalphi was the fruit of commerce; and the voluntary attachment ·
of Venice was finallyennobled b'y an equal alliance with the eastern.

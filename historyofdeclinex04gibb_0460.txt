senate, and the people. He alone remed, or seemed to reslst‚ his

own elevation3 and his humble petition, that Maurice would be

pleased to reject the choice of the Romans, could only serve to exalt
his charad‘ter in the eyes of the emperor and the public. XVhen the
fatal mandate was proclaimed‚ Gregory solicited vthe aid of some
friendly merchants to convey him in a basket beyond the gates of
Rome, and modestly concealed himself some days among the woods
and mountains, till his retreat was discovered, as it is said, by a ce-
lestia] light.

The pontificate of Gregory the Greczt, which lasted thirteen years
fix months and ten days, is one of the most edifying periods of the
history of the church. His virtues, and even his faults, a singular
mixture of fimplicity and cunning, of pride and humility, of sense
and superstition, were happily suited to his station and to the temper
of the times. In his rival, the patriarch of Constantinople, he con-

demned the Anti—christian title of universal bishop, which the suc-

cessor of St. Peter was too haughty to concede, and too feeble to
affume3 and the ecelefiastical jurisdiction of Gregory was confined
to the triple character of bissiop of Rome, primate of Italy,
and apostle of the WVest. He frequently ascended the pulpit, and
kindled, by his rude though pathetic eloquence, the congenial pas-
sxons of his audience: the language of the Jewish prophets was
interpreted and applied, and the minds of a people, depressed by
their present calamities, were directed to the hopes and sear-s of the
iiivifible world. His precepts and example defined the model of
the Roman litui-gy⁶⁹; the distribution of the parmam, the calendar
of festivals, the order of proceffions, the service of the priests and

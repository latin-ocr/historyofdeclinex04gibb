THE DECLINE AND FALL

miles, a rare variety of soil and climate3 the intermediate vallies
and elevated plains abound with rich pastures, perpetual streams,
and fruits ofa delicious taste and uncommon magnitude. This fair
solitude is decorated with the ruins of Lambesai, a Roman city once
the seat of a legion, and the refidence of forty thousand inhabitants.
The Ionic temple of AEsculapius is encompaffed with Moorish huts3
and· the cattle now graze in the midst of an amphitheatre, under the

their defeat: and as Solomon pursued his march to the west, the
long-lost province of Mauritanian Sitifi was again annexed to the
Roman empire. The Moorilh war continued several years after
the departure of Belisarius; but the laurcls which he resigned to a
faithful lieutenant, may be justly ascribed to his own triumph.

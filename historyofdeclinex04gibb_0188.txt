Distress of
the city.

THE. DECLINE AND FALL

sarius praised the spirit of his troops, condemned their presumption,
yielded to their clamours‚ and prepared the remedies of a defeat, the
poffibility of which he alone had courage to suscht. In the quarter
of the Vatican, the Romans prevailed3 and if the irreparable rno-
ments had not been wasted in the pillage of the camp, they might
have occupied the Milvian bridge, and charged in the rear of the
Gothic host. On the other fide of the Tyber, Belisarius advanced

started back with affright from the formidable aspect of an armed
rampart. The reputation of Belisarius was unsullied by a defeat;

private property were infringed by the strong plea of the public
safety. It might eafily be foreseen that the enemy would intercept
the aqueduCt33 and the cessation of the water-mille, was the first in-
convenience, which was speedily removed by mocffimg large vess'els,
and fixing mill-flones, in the current of the river. The stream was
soon embarraffcd by the trunks of trees, and polluted with dead
bodies; yet so effectual were the precautions of the Roman general,
that the waters of the Tyber still continued to give motion to the

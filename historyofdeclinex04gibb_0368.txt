1THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H Α P· the age of peace and learning, between Cicero and ·the last of the

ι-Ὴμ Antonines, many loffes had been already sustained, and some lumi-

naries of the school, or forum, were known only to the curious by
tradition and report. Three hundred and fixty years of disorder

and decay accelerated the progress of oblivion; and it may fairly ⁸

be presumed, that of the writi11g8‚ which Justinian is accused of ne-
glecffing, many were no longer to be found in the libraries of the
East ³⁵. The copies of Papinian or Ulpian, which the reformet had
proscribed‚ were deemed unworthy of future notice3 the twelve
tables and praetorian ediec insensibly vanished‚ and the monuments

of ancient Rome were neglecred or destroyed by the envy and ig· -

norance of the Greeks. Even the Pandefis themselves have escaped
With difficulty and danger from the common shipwreck, and cri-
ticism has pronounced, that czll the editions and manuscripts of the
West are derived from one original⁸⁵. It was transcribed at Con·
stantinople in the beginning of the seventh century⁸⁷‚ was succeffively

defts are quoted by Ivo of Chartres (who died
in 1117), by Theobald, archbishop of Can-

35 Pomponius (Pandea. 1. i. tit. ii. leg. 2.)
observes, that of the three soum-ers of the

civil law, Mucius, Brutus, and Manilius, ex-
tant volumina, scripta Manilii monumenta;
that of some old republican lawyers, haec ver-
santur eorum scripta inter manus hominurn.
Eight of the Angustan sagos were reduced to
a compendium: of Cascellius, scripta non
extant sed unus liber, &c.; of Trebatius,
minus frequentantur3 of Tubero, libri pa-
rurn grati sunt. Many quotations in the
pandens are derived from books which Tri-
bonian never saw; and, in the long period
from the viith to the xiisth cenzury of Rome,
the apparent reading of the moderns succes-
fively depends 011 the knowledge and veracity
of their predeceffors.

Brenckman (Hist. Pande& Florent. l. i. c. ε’,

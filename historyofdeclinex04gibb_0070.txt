Q concluded till they had delivered their prisoners *and satisfied their

revenge· The palace of the praesefi't, who withstood the seditious
torrent, was instantly burm, his Officers and guards were massam-ed,
the prisons were forced open, and freedom was restored to those
who could only use it for the public destrudtion. A military force,
which had been dispatched to the aid of the civil magistrate, was
fiercely encountered by an armed multitude, whose numbers and
boldness continually encreased3 and the Heruli, the wildest Bar-
barians in the service of the empire‚ overturned the priests and their
relies, which, from a pious motive, had been rashly interposed to
separate the bloody conflidh The tumult was exasperated by this
sacrilege, the people fought with enthufiasm in the cause of God ς
the women, from the roofs and windows, showered stones on the
heads of the soldiers‚ who darted firebrands against the houses; and
the various flames, which had been kindled by the hands of citizens
and strangers, spread without controul over the face of the city.
The conflagration involved the cathedral of St. Sophia, the baths of
ZeuxippuS, a part of the palace, from the first entrance to the altar of
Mars, and the long portico from the palace to the forum of Constan-
tine 3 a large hospital, vvith the sick patients, was consumed 3 many
churches and stately edifices were destroyed, and an immense trea-
sure of gold and filver was either melted or lost. From such scenes
of horror and distress, the wife and wealthy citizens escaped over
the Bosphorus to the Afiatic side3 and during five days Constanti-
nople was abandoned to the fastions, whose watch-word, NJKA,
vanqug'fh Ι has given a name to this memorable sedition⁵².

extraneous ornaments, and left naked and desolate, a considerable
part even of the seven hills. Yet Rome, in its present state, could
send into the field above thirty thousand males of a military age ⁷⁸ 3
and, notwithstanding the want of discipline and exer-eise, the far
greater part, enured to the hardships of poverty‚ might be capable of
bearing arms for the defence of their country and religion. The
prudence of Belisarius did not neglecst this important resource. His
soldiers were relieved by the zeal and diligence of the people, who
watched while they ssept‚ and laboured while they reposed: he ac-
cepted the voluntary service of the bravest and most indigent of the
'Roman youth; and the companies of townsmen sometimes repre-
sented, in a vacant post, the presence of the troops which had been
drawn away to more essential duties. But his just confidence was
placed in the veter-ans who had fought under his banner in the
Perfian and African wars; and although that gallant band was re-
duced to five thousand men, he undertook, with such contemptible
numbers, to defend a circle of twelve miles, against an army of one
hundred and fifty thousand Barbarians. In the walls of Rome,
which Belisarius construeted or restored, the materials of ancient
architectum may be discerned⁷⁹3 and the whole fortification was
completed‚ except in a chasm still extant between the Pincian and
Flaminian gates, which the prejudices of the Goths and Romans
left under the effeetual guard of St. Peter tlse apostle ³⁰. The battle-

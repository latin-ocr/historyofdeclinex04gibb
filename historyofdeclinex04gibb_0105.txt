OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 101

warks of Athens and Plataea, were carefully restored ; the Barbarians C {LA Ρ-

were discouraged by the prospe& of succeffive and painful lieges3 cnr-„2
and the naked cities of Peloponnesus were covered by the fortifi-
cations of the isthmus of Corinth. At the extremity of Europe,
another peninsula, the Thracian Chersonesus, runs three days jour-
’ ney into the sea, to form, with the adjacent shores of Asia, the
streights of the Hellespont. The intervals between ele-ven popu-
lous towns were filled by lofty woods, fair pasture5‚ and arable
, lands3 and the isthmus, of thirty-seven stadia or furlongS, had been
fortified by a Spartan general nine hundred years before the reign
of Justinian ¹¹⁷. In an age of freedom and valour, the ssightest ram-
part may prevent a surprise ; and Procopius appears insensible of the
superiority of ancient times, while he praises the solid construfflon and-
double parapet of a wall, whose long arms stretched on either side
i‘nto the sea ; bur whose strength was deeined insufficient to guard the
Chersonesus, if each city, and particularly Gallipoli and Sellus, had
not been secured by their peculiar fortifications. The long wall, as it
was emphatically styled, was a work as disgraeeful in the obje&‚ as
it was respe&'able in the execution. The riches of a capital diffuse
themselves over the neighbouring country, and the territory os Con-
stantinople, a paradise of nature, was adorned with the luxurious
gardens and villas of the senators and opulent citizens. But their
wealth served only to atti-ast the bold and rapacious Barbarians;
the noblest of the Romans, in the bosom of peaceful indolence, were
led away into Scythiam captivity, and their sovereign might view
from his palaee the hostile flames which were insolently spread to
the gates of the Imperial city. At the distance only of forty miles,

Anastasius was constrained to establilh a last frontier 3 his long wall of

OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 353

sanction and preference to his private sentiments: the opinion of a 0 >1221ss P„
censor, or a consul, was entertained with respedh and a doubtful ι-νῲ
interpretation of the laws might be supported by the virtues or
triumphs of the civilian. The patrician arts were long prote&ed by
the veil of mystery; and in more enlightened times, the freedom of
enquiry establiffied the general principles of jurisprudenee. Subtle
and intricate cases were elucidated by the disputes of the forum:
rules, axioms, and definitions⁵⁹, were admitted as the genuine die-
tates of reas0n3 and the consent of the legal profeffors was inter-
woven into the practice of the tribunals. But these interpreters
could neither ena& nor execute the laws of the republic3 and the
judges might disregard the authority of the Scaevolas themselves,
which was often overthrown by the eloquence or sophistry of an
ingenious pleader⁶⁰. Augustus and Tiberius were the first to adopt,
as an useful engine‚ the science of the civilians ; and their servile
labours accommodated the old system to the spirit and views of des-
potism. Under the fair pretence of securing the dignity of the art,
the privilege of subscribing legal and valid opinions was confined to
the fages of senatorian or equestrian rank, who had been previQussy
approved by the judgment of the prince3 and this monopoly pre-
vailed, till Hadrian restored the freedorn of the profession to every
citizen conscious of his abilities and knowledge. The discreti0n of
the praetor was now governed by the leffons of his teachers; the
judges were enjoined to obey the comment as well as the text of
the law ; and the use of codicils was a memorable innovation, which

Augustus ratified by the advice of the civilians⁶’.

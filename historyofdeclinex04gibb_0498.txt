THE DECLINE AND FALL

diseretion, of Phocas had spared these unhappy femalcs‚ and they .
were decently confined to a private house. But the spirit of the
cmpress Constantina, still mindful of her father, her husband, and
her sons, aspired to freedom and revenge. At the dead of night,
she escaped to the sanetuary of St. Sophia3 but her tenrs, and the
gold of her associate Germanus, were insufficient to provoke an in-
surreffion. Her life was forfeited to revenge, and even to justice:
but the patriarch obtained and pledged an oath for her safety3 a
monastery was allotted for her prison, and the widow of Maurice
accepted and abused the lenity of his affaffin. The discovery or
the suspicion of a second conspiracy, diffolved the engagements and
rekindled the fury of Phocas. A matron who commanded the re-
spect'and pity of mankind, the daughter, wife, and mother of em-
perors, was tortured like the vilest malefaeror, to force a confeffion
of her defigns and affociate53 and the empress Constantina, with her
three innocent daughters, was beheaded at Chalcedon, on the same
ground which had been stained with the blood of her husband and
five sons. After such an example, it would be superfluous to enu-
merate the names and sufferings of nieaner viffims. Their con-
demnation was seldom preceded by the forms of trial, and their
punishment was embittered by the refinements of cruelty: their
eyes were pierced‚ their tongues were torn from the root, the hands
and feet wereamputatech some expired under the laih, others in
the flames, others again were transfixe-d with arrows; and a simple
speedy death was mercy which they could rarely obtain. The.
hippodrome, the sacred asylum of the pleasures and the liberty of
the Romans, was polluted with heads and limbs, and mangled bodies3
and the companions of Phocus were the most senfible, that neither

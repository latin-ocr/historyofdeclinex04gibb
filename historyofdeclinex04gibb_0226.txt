one hundred and twenty thousand of the subjecte of Justinian. In
a subsequent inroad they pierced the wall of the Thracian Cherso-
nesus, extirpated the habitations and the inhabitants, boldly tra-
versed the Hellespont‚ and returned to their companions, laden with
the spoils of Afia. Another party, which seemed a multitude in
the eyes of the Romans, penetrated‚ without oppofition, from the
streights of Thermopylae to the isthmus of Corinth; and the last
ruin of Greece has appeared an obje& too minute for the attention
of history. The works which the emperor raised for the protection,
but at the expence of his subjecta served only to disclose the weak-
ness of some neglected part; and the walls, which by flattery had
,been dcemed impregnable, were either deserted by the garrison, or
scaled by the Barbariana. Three thousand Sclavonians‚ who inso-
lently divided themselves into two bands, discovered the weakness
and misery of a triumphant reign. They passed the Danube and
-the Hebrus, vanquiffied the Roman generals who dared to oppose
their progress, and plundered, with impunity, the cities of Illyricum
and Thrace, each of which had arms and numbers to overwhelm
their contemptible affailants. W'hatever praise the boldness of the
Sclavonians may deserve, it is sullied by the wanton and deliberate
cruelty which they are accused of exercifing on their prisoners.
Without distinffion of rank, or age, or sex, the captives were im-
paled or flayed alive, or suspended between four postS, and beaten
with clubs till they expired, or inclosed in some spacious building,
and left to perish in the flames with the spoil and cattle which might

impede the march of these savage vietors²⁰. Perhaps a more im-

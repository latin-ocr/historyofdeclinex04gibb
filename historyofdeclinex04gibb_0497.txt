tial historian has delineated the portrait of a monster ⁴⁹3 his diminu-
tive and desormed person, the closeness of his sslaggy eye-brows, his
red hair, his beardless chin, and his cheek disfigured and discoloured
by a formidable scar. Ignorant of letters, of laws, and even of
Χ arms, he indulged in the supreme rank a more ample privilege of
lust and drunkenness, and his brutal pleasures were either injurious
to his subjects or disgraceful to himself. without affuming the
office of a prince, he renounced the profeffion of a soldier3 and the
reign of Phocas afflicted Europe with ignominious peace, and Afia
with desolating war. His savage temper was inflamed by paffion,
hardened by fear, exasperated by refistance or reproach. The flight
of Theodofius to the Perfian court had been intercepted by a rapid
pursuit‚ or a deceitful meffage: he was beheaded at Nice, and the
last hours of the young prince were soothed by the comforts of re·-

flattery‚ the topic of protestant inveffive, is
justly censured by the philosopher Bayle (Dic-

p. 597, 598). Cardinal eroniusjustifies the
pope at the expence of the fallen emperor.

but even the malice of his enemies would suf-
fer one copy of such a portrait or caricatura

(Cedrenns, p. 404.) to escape the flames.

by Ducange (Famniae Byzantinos, μισῶ, 107,

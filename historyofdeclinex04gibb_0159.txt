been their empire, it became their prison3 nor could they entertain z-v--s

an hope, or even a wish, of returning to the banks of the Elbo,
where their brethren‚ of a spirit less adventurous‚ still wandered in
their native forests. It was impoffible for cowards to surmount the
barriers of unknown seas and hostile Barbarians: it was impossible
· for brave men to expose their nakedness and defeat before the
eyes of their countrymen, to describe the kingdoms which they had
lost, and to claim a share of the humble inheritance, which, in a
happier hour, they had almost unanimoussy renounced³⁷. In the
country between the Elbe and the Oder, several populous villages
of Lusatia are inhabited by the Vandals: they still preserve their
language, their customs, and the purity of their b100d3 support
with some impafience, the Saxon, or Pruffian yoke3 and serve with
secret and voluntary allegiance, the descendant oftheir ancient kings,
who in his garb and present fortune is confounded with the meanest
of his vaffals³⁸. The name and situation of this unhappy people
*might indicate their descent from one common stoek with the con-
querors of Africa, But the use of a Sclavonian dialect inore clearly
represents them as the last remnant of the new colonies, who suc-
ceeded to the genuine Vandals‚ already scattered or destroyed in the

age of Procopius ³⁹.

p. 129, 130, ¹3¹· Paris, 1688.) describes the
Mauritania Gaditana (opposite to Cadiz), ubi
gens Vandalorum, a Belisario devicta in Afri-
ca, fugit, et nunquam comparuit.

³⁷ A single voice had protested, and Gen-
scric dismissed, without a formal answer, the
Vandals of Germany: but those of Africa
derided his prudente, and affected to despise
the poverty of their forests (Procopius, Van-
dal, l. i. c. 22.)-

³³ From the mouth of the great elefior (iu
1687), Tollius describes the secret royalty and
rebellious spirit of the Vandals of Branden-
burgh, who could muster five or fix thousand
soldiers who had procured some carmon, ἃς.
(itinerar. Hungar. p. 42. apud Dubos, Hist.
de la Monarchie Francoise, tom. i. p. 132.

of Tollius himself, mayjustly be suspened.

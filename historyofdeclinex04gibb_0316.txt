whose names were corrupted by the ignorance or vanity of the

Greeks⁵³. After the battle of Cafilinum, Narses entered the capita13

the praises of the conqueror3 and Rome, for the last time, beheld
the semblance of a triumph.

After a reign of fixty years, the throne of the Gothic kings
was filled by the Exarchs of Ravenna, the representatives in peace
and war of the emperor of the Romans. Their jurisdiCti0n was soon
reduced to the limits of a narrow province : but Narses himself, the
first and most powerful of the Exarchs, administered above fifteen
years the entire kingdom of Italy. Like Belisarius, he had deserved
the honours of envy, calumny‚ and disgrace: but the favourite
eunuch still enjoyed the confidence of Justinian‚ or the leader of a
victorious army awed and repressed the ingratitude of a timid
court. Yet it was not by weak and mischievous indulgence that
Narses secured the attachment of his troops. Forgetful of the past,
and regardless of the future, they abused the present hour of pro-
sperity and peace. The cities of Italy resounded with the noise
of drinking and dancing: the spoils> of vidiory were wasted in
sensual pleasure33 and nothing (says Agathias) remained‚ unless to

on their former basis. The origin of Imperial legissation was con-

cealed by the darkness of ages and the terrors of armcd despotism ;
and a double fistion was propagated by the servility, or perhaps the
ignorance, of the civilians who basked in the sunssiine of the Roman
and Byzantine courts. 1. To the prayer of the ancient Caesars‚ the
people or the senate had sometimes granted a personal exemption
from the obligation and penalty of particular statutes ; and each in-
dulgence was an a& of jurisdifflon exercised by the republic over
the first of her citizens. His humble privilege was at length trans-
formed into the prerogative of a tyrant; and the Latin expreflion
of “ released from the laws³⁸,’' was supposed to exalt the emperor
above all human restraints, and to leave his conscience and reason,
as the sacred measure of his conduCt. 2. A fimilar dependance was
implicd in the decrees of the senate, which, in every reign, defined

the titles and powers of an elestive magistrate. But it was not be-< ι’,

fore the ideas, and even the language, of the Romans had been cor-
rupted, that a royal law³⁹, and an irrevocable gift of the p'eople,
were created by the fancy of Ulpian, 01· more probably of Tribonian
himself ⁴⁰: and the origin of Imperial power, though false in fast,
and ssavish in its consequence, was supported on a principle of free-
dom and justice. “ The pleasure of the emperor has the vigour
“ and effe& of law, since the Roman people‚ by the royal law, have
“ transferred to their prmce the full extent of their own power and

THE DECLINE AND FALL

Before Lucca had surrendered, Italy was overwhelmed by a new
deluge of Barbarians. A feeble youth, the grandson of Clovis,
reigned over the Austrafians or oriental Franks. The guardians off
Theodebald entertained with coldness and rcludhmce the magnificent
promises of the Gothic ambass'adorS. But the spirit of a martial
people outstripped the timid counsels of the court: two brothers,
Lothaire and Buccelin⁴⁸, the dukes of the Alamanni, stood forth as
the leaders of the Italian war3 and seventy-five thousand Germans
descended in the autumn from the Rhaetian Alps into the plain of
Milan. The vanguard of the Roman army was stationed near· the
Po, under the conduc‘t of Fulearis, a bold Herulian, who rashly con-
ceived‚ that personal bravery was the sole duty and merit of a
commander. As he marched without order or precaution along
the AEmilian way, an ambuscade of Franks suddenly rose from the
amphitheatre of Parma: his ⁴troops were surprised and routed ; but
their leader refused to fly ; declaring to the last moment, that death.
was less terrible than the angry countenance of Narses. The death
of Fulcaris, and the retreat of the surviving chiefs, decided the fluc-
tuating and rehellious temper of the Goth33 they flew to the stan-
dard of their deliverers, and admitted them into the cities which
still refisted the arms ofthe Roman general. The conqueror of Italy
opened a free passage to the irresistible torrent of Barbarians. They
passed under the walls of Cesena‚ and answered by threats and re-
proaches the advice of Aligern‚ that the Gothic treasures could no
longer repay the labour of an invasion. Two thousand Franks were
destroyed by the skill and valour of Narses himself, who sallied
from Rimini at the head of three hundred horse, to chastise the
historyof Agathias. We must now relinquish he discomfited and ssew Belisarius, subdued

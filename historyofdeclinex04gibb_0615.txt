comforting his brethren, he embarked for Constantinople‚ and sus- μη...]

tained, in six succeffive interviews, the almost irrefistible weight of
the royal presence. His opinions were favourably entertained in the
palace and the city3 the influence of Theodora affured him a safe
conduet and honourable dismiffion3 and he ended his days, though
not on the throne, yet in the bosom, of his native country. On the
news of his death, Apollinaris indecently feasted the nobles and the
clergy3 but his joy was checked by the intelligence of a new elec-
tion3 and while he enjoyed the wealth of Alexandria, his rivals
reigned in the monasteries of Thebais, and were maintained by the
voluntary oblations of the people. A perpetual succession of pa-
triarchs arose fromx> the ashes of Theodofius3 and the Monophyfite
churehes of Syria and Egypt were united by the name of Jacobites
and the communion of the saith. But the same saith, which has
been confined to a narrow se& of the Syrians, was diffused over the
mass of the Egyptian or Coptic nation; who, almost unanimoussy,
reJedted the decrees of the synod of Chalcedon. A thousand years
were now elapsed fince Egypt had ceased to be a kingdom, fince
'the conquerors of Afia and Europe had trampled on the ready necks
of a people, whose ancient wisdom and power ascends beyond the.
records of history. The confli& of zeal and persecution rekindled
some sparks of their national spirit. They abjured, with a foreign
heresy, the manners and language of the Greeks: every Melehite,
in their eye5‚ was a stranger‚ every Jacobite a citizen3 the alliance
of marriage, the offices of humanity, were condemned as a deadly
lin3 the nat'ssres renounced all allegiance to the emperor3 and his
orders, at a distance from Alexandria, were obeyed only under the
pressure of military force. A generous effort might have redeemed
the religion and liberty of Egypt, and her six hundred monasteries
might have poured forth their myriads of holy warriors, for whom
death should have no terrors, fince life had no comfort or delight.

lover of his wife, the vain and insolent Harmafius, who, 'm the

surname pf Achilles Β. By the conspiracy of the malecontents, Zeno

was recalled from exile, the armies, the capital, the person of Bali-

long agony of eold and hunger by the inhuman conqueror, who

wanted courage to encounter or to forgive his enemies. The haughty

spirit of Verina was still incapable of submiffion or repose. She
provoked the enmity of a favourite general, embraced his cause as

raised an army of seventy thousand men, and perfisted to the last

moment of her life in a fruitless rebellion, which, according to the

fashion of the age, had been predics‘oed by Christian hermits and

Verina, her daughter Ariadne was distinguissied by the female vir-

Secret history
of his wife

THE DECLINE AND FALL·

ploits has observed, that amidst the perils of war, he was daring
without rashness‚ prudent without fear, ssow or rapid according to
the exigences of the moment; that in the deepest distress, he was
animated by real or apparent hope, but that he was modest and
humble in the most prosper-ons fortune. By these virtues, he equalled

father exercised at Thessalonica and Constandnople, the vile, though-
lucrative, profeffion of charioteers. In the various situations of their

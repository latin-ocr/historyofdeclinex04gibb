THE DECLINE AND FALL

in lineal deseent‚ the second branch of the English legissature, which
maimedus, between the king and commons, the balance of the con-
stitution. A gradation of patricians and plebeians, of stran'gers and
sumens, has supported the aristocracy of Genoa, Venice, and an-
cient Rome. The perfect equality of men is the point in which
the extremes of democracy and despotism are confounded3 fince
the majesty of the prince or people would be offended, if any heads
were exalted above the level of their fellow-ssaves or fellow-citizens.
In the decline of the Roman empne, the proud distin&ions of the re-
public were gradually aboliffied, and the reason or instinct of Justi-
nian completed the simple form of an absolute monarchy. The
emperor could not eradicate the popular reverence which always
waits on the poffeflion of hereditary wealth or the memory of fa-
mous ancestors. He delighted to honour with titles and emolu-
ments, his generals, magistrates, and senator53 and his precarious
indulgence communicated some rays of their glory to the persons
of their wives and children. But in the eye of the law, all Roman
citizens were equal, and all subjecC'ts of the empire were citizens of
Rome. That inestimable charadier was degraded to an obsolete and
empty name. The voice of a Roman could no longer ena& his
laws, or create the annual ministers of his power: his constitutional
rights ,might have checked the arbitrary will of a master; and the
bold adventurer from Germany or Arabia was admitted, with equal
favour, to the civil and military command, which the citizen alone
had been once entitlcd to ass'umc over the conquests of his fathers.

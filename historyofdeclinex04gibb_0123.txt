, Chosroes. He required, that the seven fages who had visited the
court of Persia, ssiould be exempted from thc penul laws which Jus-
tinianena6³oed against his l‘agan subjects5 and this privilege, QX-
pressly stip-ulated in a treaty of peace, was guardcd by the vigilance
of a. powerful mediator-¹⁵⁵. Simplicius and his companions ended
their lives in peace and obscurity3 and as they left no disciples, they
terminate the long list of Grecian philosophers, who may be justly
praised, notwithstanding their defects, as the wisest and most virtu-
ous of their contemporaries. The writings of Simplicius are now
extant. His phyfical and metaphyfical commentaries on Aristoth:
have paffed away with the fashion of the times; but his moral in—
terpretation of Epictetus, is preserved in the library of nadons, as a
claffic book, most excellently adapted to dii·ect the will, to purify
the beart, and to confirm the understanding, by a just confidence in
the nature both of God and man.

About the same time that Pythagoras first invented the appellation
of philosopher, liberty and the consulship were founded at Rome by
the elder Brutus. The revolutione of the consular office, which may
be viewed in the succeffive lights of a substance, a shadow and a
name, have been occasionally mentioned in the present history. The
first magistrates of the republic had been chosen by the people‚ to
exercise, in the senate and in the camp, the powers of peace and
war, which were afterwards transsated to the emperors. But the
tradition of ancient dignity was long revered by the Romans and
Barbarians. A Gothic historian applauds the consulship of Theo-

¹⁵⁵ Agathias (l. ii. p.69‚ 70, 71.) relates 533, a date most compatible with his young
this curious story. Chosroes ascended the fame and the old nge of Isidore (Affeman,
throne in the year 531, and made his first Bibliot. orient. tom. iii. p. 404- Ρὸἒῐι ¹⁰⁸¹·
peace with the Romans in the. beginning of ii. p. 543. 550.).

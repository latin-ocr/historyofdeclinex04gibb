232 THE DECLINE AND FALL

Ο {gd} P. of the day: the tent was surroundcd with silk hangings, and a
2--v-ss-v Tartar vliquor was served on the table, which possessed at least the in-
toxicating qua‘lities of wine. The entertainment of the succeeding
day was more sumptuous; the filk hangings of the second tent were
embroidered in various figures; and the royal seat, the cupS, and the
vases, were of gold. A third pavilion was supported by columns of
gilt woOd ; a bed of pure and maffy gold was raised on four pea-

“ to my subjects another3 and the nations are successively deluded
“ by your perfidious eloquence. You precipitate your allies into
“ war and danger, you enjoy their labours, and you negleil: your
‘⁶ benefactors. Hasten your return, inform your master that a Turk

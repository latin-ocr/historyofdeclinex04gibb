is now divided by the Elf'jahs of Mosul, the representatives, almost

in lineal descent, of the genuine and primitive suceession, the Joſs‘phs

of Amida, who are reconciled to the church of Rome¹²¹, and the

Simeons of Van or Ormia, whose revolt, at the head of forty thou-

sand families, was promoted in the fixteenth century by the Sopliis

of Persia. The number of three hundred thousand is allowed for

the whole body of the Nestorians, who, under the name of Chal-
daeans or Affyrians, are confounded with the most learned or the

According to the legend of antiquity, the gospel was preached in

India by St. Thomas ¹²².

At the end of the ninth century, his

ssirine, perhaps in the neighbourhood of Madras, was devoutly

THE DECLINE AND FALL

retain the power which 116 was incapable of exercismg3 and Juffin,
holding his purple with both his hands, advised them to prefer, since
an 616611011 was so profitable, some older candidate. Notwithstand-
ing this reproach, the senate proceedcd to decorate Justinian with
the royal epithet of nobilg‘fflmus ,· and their decrce was ratified by the
affection or the fears of his uncle. After some time the languor of
mind and body, to which 116 was reduced by an incur-able wound
in his thigh, indispensably required the aid of a guardian. He
summoned the patriarch and senators; and in their presence solemnly
placed the diadem on the head of his nephew‚ who was conducted
from the palace to the circus, and saluted by the loud and joyful
applause of the people. The life of Justin was prolonged about four
months, but from the instant of this cerem0ny‚ he was considered
as dead to the empire, which acknovvledged Justinian, in the forty-
fifth year of his age, for the lawful sovereign of the East¹².

From his elevation to his death, Justinian governed the Roman
empire thirty-eight years, seven months, and thirteen days. The
events of his reign, which excite our curious attention by their

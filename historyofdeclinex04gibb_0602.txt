THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A P. of St. Thomas had been seated for ages on the coast of Malabar, and

W the difference of their charadter and colour attested the mixture of

a foreign race. In arms, in arte, and poffibly in virtue, they ex-
celled the natives of Hindostan: the husbandmen cultivated the
palm—nee, the merchants were enriched by the pepper trade, the
soldiers preceded the nait-s or nobles of Malabar, and their hereditary
privileges were respected by the gratitude or the fear of the king of
Cochin and the Zamorin himself. They acknovvledged a Gentoo

was first presented to the disciples of St. Thomas, they indignantly
exclaimed, “ We are Christians, not idolaters !'’ and their simple
devotion was content with the veneration of the cross. Their sepa-
ration from the western world had left thern in ignorance of the

THE DECLINE AND FALL

Theodoret of Cyn-hus, and Ihas of Edessa, to the communion of the

xm chureh. But the chax-aerem of these Oriental bishops were tainted

with the reproach of heresy ; the first had been the master, the two
others were the friends, of Nestorius: their most suspicions passages
were accused under the title of the three chapters ,- and the con-
demnation of their memory must involve the honour ⁴of a synod,
whose name was pronounced with smeere or affeered reverence by

But the 'Latin churches were more jealous of the honour of Leo
and the synod of Chalcedon; and if they had fought as they usually
did under the standard of Rome, they might have prevailed in the
cause of reason andhumansty. But their chief was a prisoner in the
hands of the enemy3 the throne of St. Peter, which had been dis-

fortv thousand columns of filver, or more probably of mai-hle, and
plated wood, that supported the roos 3 and the thousand globes of
gold suspended in the dome to imitate the motions of the planets
and the constellations of the zodiac ⁶⁷. While the Persian monarch
contemplated the wonders of his art and power, he received an epistle-
from an obscure citizen of Mecca, inviting him to acknowledge
Mahomet as the apostle of God. He rejeeted .the invitation, and
tore the epistle. “ It is thus,'' exclaimed the Arabian prophet,
“ that God will tear the kingdom, and rejee‘t the supplications of
“ Chofi-oes⁶⁸.” Placed on the verge of the two great empires of the
East, Mahomet observed with secret joy, the progress of their mu-
tual destrquon, and in the midst of the Persian triumphs, he ven-
tured to foretell, that before many years should elapse, vietory would

again return to the banners of the Romans ⁶⁹.

At the time when this predicffion is said to have been delivered,
no prophecy could be more distant from its accomplishment, fince
the first txvelve years of Heraclius announced the approaching diffo-

lution of the empire. If the motivcs of Chosroes had been pure

⁶⁸ The historians of Mahomet‚ Abulfeda
(in Vit. Mohamrned, Ρ. 9:, 93.) and Gagnier
(Vie de Mahomet, torn. ii. p. ²47), date this
embassy in the viitb year of the hcgira, which
commences A. D. 628, May 11. Their chro-
nology is erroneouS, fince Chosroes died in the
mouth of February of the same year (Pagi,

soon aster the conquest of palestine. Yet
Mahomet would scarcely have ventured so
soon on so bold a step.

prophe-cy of a future event, which must, in
his opinion, embarrass the Christian polemics.

tradition has prevailed, that the Roman fleet was reduced to ashes:
in the port of Syracuse by the burning-glaffes of Archi1nedes⁹³3 and
it is asserted, that a similar expedient was employed by Proclus to
destroy the Gothic vessels in the harbour of Constantinople, and to
prote& his benefac³oer Anastasius against the bold enterprize of Vi-
talian⁹⁶. A machine was fixed on the walls of the city, consisting
of an hexagon mirror of polilhed brass, with many smaller and
moveable polygons to receive¹ and reflest the rays of the meridiam
sun ; and a consuming flame was darted to the distance, perhaps, of
*two hundred feet⁹⁷. The truth of these two extraordinary saCts is

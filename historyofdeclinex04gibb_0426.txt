422 ' THE ‘DECL'INE AND FALL

C ,1)Ηρ Ρ- “ How dear is that place—how haleful is that person—'⁹ were the
ψὛ-μ words that escaped, with a sigh, from the indignant father. His
grief-exasperated the national resentment of the Gepidae3 and Cuni-
mund‚ his surviving son, was provoked by wine, 01· fraternal affection,
to the defu-e of vengeance. ‘⁶ The Lombards‚'’ said the rude Bar-

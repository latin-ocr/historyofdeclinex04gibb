THE DECLINE AND FALL

more accurate edition of the same work3 which he enriched with
two hundred of his own laws, and fifty decifions of the darkest and
most intricate points of jurisprudence. Every year, or, according
to Procopius, each day, of his long reign, was marked by some legal
innovation. Many of his aeis were rescinded by himself ; many

century3 an edi& so pregnant with injustiee and disorder‚ that after
serving this occafional purpose, it was prudently abolished in the
same reign⁹⁶. If candour will aequit the emperor himself, and trans-

offered too late, the number of his troops was defeated by the nurn-

and both the living and the dead were abandoned to the vvild beasts
of the desert. The resistance of Edeffa, and the deficiency of spoil,
inclined the mind of Cabades to peace: he sold his conquests for an
exorbitant price; and the same line, though marked with ssaughter

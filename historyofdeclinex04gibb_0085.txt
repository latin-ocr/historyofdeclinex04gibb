lous; private malice is bold3 and a lover of truth will pernse with
a suspicious eye the insti-uetive anecdotes of Procopius. The ile-,-
cret historiam represents only the vizes of justinian, and those vices
are darkened by his malevolent pencil. Ambiguous affions are
imputed to the worst motives: error is confounded with gnilt, ac-
cident with design, and laws with abuses : the partial injustice of a
moment is dextroussy applied as the general maxim of a reign of
thirty-two years: the emperor alone is made responsible for the
faults of his Officers, the disorders of the times, and the corruption
of his subje&s; and even the calamities of nature, plagues, earth-
quakes, and inundations‚ are imputed to the prince of the daemons,
who had mischievoussy assumed the form of Justinian ⁸⁴.

when they were admitted into the service of the palace, obtained an
humble rank and a moderate stipend3 they ascended by seniority
to a station of affluence and repose3 the annual pensions, of which
the most honourable class was abolished by Justinian, amounted to
four hundred thousand pounds; and this domestic oeconomy was
deplored by the venal or indigent courtiers as the last outrage on
the majesty of the empire. The posts, the salax-ies of physicians,
and the 1iofiurnal illuminations, were obje&s of more general eon-
cern3 and the cities might jnstly eomplain, that he usui-ped the mn-

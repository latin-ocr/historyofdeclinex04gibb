150 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {31-[2 P, dured3 bnt his aetuavl'misery was embittered by the recolleffion of
s--ssvssss-„J past greatness, the daily insolence of his protectors, and the just
apprehension, that the light and venal Moors might be tempted to
betray the rights of hospitality. The knowledge of his fituation
di&ated the humane and friendly epistle of Pharas. “ Like you1·self,'’
said the chief of the Heruli, “ I am an illiterate Barbarian‚ but Ι speak
“ the language of plain sense, and an honest heart. Why will you
“ persist in hopeless obstinacy? Why will you ruin yourself, your
·“ family, and nation? The love of freedom and abhorrence of ssa-
“ very? Alas! my dearest Gelimer‚ are you not already the worst of
“ ssaveS, the ssave of the vile nation of the Moors? Would it not be
“ preferable to sustain at Constantinople alife of poverty and servitude,
“ rather than to reign the undoubted monarch of the mountain of
‘⁶ Papua? Do you think it a disgrace to be the subjecit of Justinian?
‘⁶ Belisarius is his subje&; and we ourselves, whose birth is not iu-
“ ferior to your own, are not assiamed of our obedience to the Ro-
“ man emperor. That generous prince will grant you a rich inhe-
“ ritanee of lands, a place in the senate, and the dignity of Patri-
“ cian ί such are his gracious intentions‚ and you may depend with
“ full assurance on the word of Belisarius. So long as heaven has
“ condemned us to suffer, patience is a virtue3 but if we reject the
“ proffered deliverauce, it degenerates into blind and stupid de-
“ spair.'' “ I am not insenfible,²’ replied the king of the Vandals,
“ how kind and rational is your advice. But I cannot persuade
‘⁸ myself to become the ssave ofan unjust enemy, who has deserved
“ my implacable hatred. Him Ι had never injured either by word
‘⁶ or deed: yet he has sent against me, Iknow not from whence,
‘⁶ a certain Belisarius, who has cast me headlong from the throne
“ into this abyss of misery. Justinian is a man3 he is a prince3
“ -does he not dread for himself a similar reverse of fortune? Ican
“ write no more: my grief oppresses me. Send me, Ibeseech you,

of parent and master.

The first limitation of paternal power is ascribed to the justice
and humanity of Numa: and the maid who, with his father's con-
sent, had espoused a freeman, was protected from the disgrace of
becoming the wife of a ssave. In the first ages, when the city was
presset] and often familhed by her Latin and Tuscan neighbours,
the sale of children might be a frequent practice3 but as a Roman

could not legally purchase the liberty of his fellow-citizen, the·

market must gradually fail, and the trade would be destroyed by the
conquests of the republic. An imperfect right of property was at

prudence of the Code and Patidefils¹⁶⁸. Of all that proceeded from
the father, he imparted only the use, and reserved the absolute do-

fair analogy was extended to the'emoluments of any liberal pro-
feffion, the salary of public service, and the sacred liberality of the
emperor or the empress. The life ofa citizen was less exposed than
his fortune to the abuse of paternal power. Yet his life might be
adverse to the interest or pallions of an unworthy father: the same
crimes that flowed from the corruption, were more senfibly felt by
the humanity‚ of the Augustan agc; and the cruel Erixo, who whipt

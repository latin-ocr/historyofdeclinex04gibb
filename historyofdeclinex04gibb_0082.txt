was impra&icable to transport the short-lived inseet, but that in the
eggs a numerous progeny might be preserved and multiplied in a
distant climate. Religion or interest had more power over the
Perfian monks than the love of their country: after a long jouruey,
they arrived at Constantinople‚ imparted their proje& to the ern-
petor, and were liber-ally encouraged by the gifts and promises of
justinian. To the historians of that prince, a campaign at the foot
of mount Caucasus has seemed more deserving of a minute relation
than the labours of these miffionaries of commerce, who again en-

tered Chim, deceived a jealous people by concealing the eggs of
the filk-worm in a hollow cane, and returned in triumph with the
spoils of the East. Under their dire&ion‚ the eggs were hatched

fed with mulberry leaves; they lived and laboured in a foreign
climate3 a sufficient number of butterflies was saved to propagate
the race, and trees were planted to supply the nourishment of the
rising generations. Experience and refleefion corredied the errors
of a new attempt, and the Sogdoite ambaffadors acknowkdged, in
the succeeding reign, that the Romans were not inferior to the
natives of China in the education of the insefis, and the manu-

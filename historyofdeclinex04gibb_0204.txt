200 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ξιξ P. nion, that the siege of Ravenna was impractieable and hopeless:
ιη’-ι the general then rejected the treaty of partition, and declared his
own resolution of leading Vitiges in chains to the feet of Justinian.
The Goths retired with doubt and dismay: this peremptory refusal
deprived them of the only fignature which they could trust, and
filled their minds with a just apprehension, that a sagacious enemy

of a Roman general. Even the patience and seeming satisfaction
with which he entertained a proposal of treason‚ might be suscep-

for the performance of a treaty which he secretly abhorred. The
day of the surrender of Ravenna was stipulated by the Gothic am-

tardy payments were detained and intercepted by the fraud of those
agents who usurp, without courage or danger, the emol-umcnts of
war. Public and private distress rceruited the armies of the state3
but in the field, and still more in the presence of the enemy, their
numbers were always (lefeetive. The want of national spirit was
supplied ‘by the precarious faith and disorderly service of Barbarian
mercenaries. Even military honour, which has often survived the
loss of virtue and freedom, was almost totally eminet. The genoe-
rals, who were multiplied beyond the example of former times,
laboured only to prevent the success, or to sully the reputation, of
their colleagues; and they had been taught by experience, that if
merit sometimes provoked the jealousy, error, or even guilt, would
obtain the indulgence, of a gracious emperor ⁴. In such an age, the
triumphs of Belisarius‚ and afterwards of Narses, ihine with incom-
parable lustre ; but they are encompafl'ed with the clarkest shades of
disgrace and calamity. While the lieutenant of Justinian subdued
the· kingdoms of the Goths and Vandals, the emperor⁵, timid,
though ambitious, balanced the forces of the Barbarians, fomented

, their divisions by flattery and falsehood‚ and invited by his patience

and liberality the repetition of injuries⁶. The keys of Carthage,
Rome, and Ravenna, were presented to their conqueror, while An-

tioch was destroyed by the Perfians, and Justinian trembled for the
safety of Constantinople.

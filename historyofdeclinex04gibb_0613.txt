powers of government were strained in his support ; he might ap- 2——v—-1
point or displace the dukes and tribunes of Egypt 3 the allowance of

'bread which Diocletian had granted, was suppresl'ed, the churchcs

were shut, and a nation of schismatics was deprived at once of their

spiritual and carnal food. In his turn, the tyrant was excommuni-

cated by the zeal and revenge of the pcople3 and >none except his

servile Melchites would salute him as a man, a Christian, or a bishop.

Yet such is the blindness of ambitum, that, when Paul was expelled

on a charge of murder, he solicited, wit—h a bribe of seven hundred

pounds of gold, his restoration to the same station of hatred and
ignominy. His successor Apollinaris entered the hostile city in Aponinaris,

cathedral were gudrded, and a chosen band was stationed in the

curses, and inved'tives, and stones, affaulted the odious minister of the

emperor and the synod. A charge was instantly founded by -the

succeffor of the apostles 3 the soldiers waded to their knees in blood ς

and two hundred thousand Christians are said to have fallen by the

sword: an incredible account, even if it be extended from the
ssaughter of a day to the eighteen years of the reign of Apollinaris.

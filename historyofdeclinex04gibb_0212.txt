208· THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {L} P. from a trusty eunuch of his mother the full confession of her guilt3 - ⁸

t--v—ssa arrested Theodofius and his treasurespin the church of St. John the

Apostle‚ and conccaled his captives, whose execution was only de-

layed, in a secure and sequestered fortress of Cilicia. Such a daring γ

” outrag‘e against public justice could not pass with impunity3 and ἰ,

the cause of Antonina was espoused by the empress, whose favour

she had deserved by the recent services of the disgrace of a praefecl,

ι-Ὗ--α of an Italian synod, Celestine weighed the merits of the cause,
approved the creed of Cyril‚ condemned the sentiments and person of
Nestorius, degraded the heretic from his episcopal dignity, allowed
a respite of ten days for recantation and penance, and delegated to
his enemy the execution of this rath and illegal sentence. But the
patriarch of Alexandria, whilst he dai-ted the thunders of a god, ex-
posed the errors and pallions of a mortalz and his twelve ana-
themas³⁹ still torture the orthodox ssaves, who adore the memory
of a saint, without forfeiting their allegiance to the synod of Chal-
cedon. These bold assertions are indelibly tinged with the colours

of the Apollinarian heresy: but the serious, and perhaps the fincere,
profeffions of Nestorius have satisfied the wiser and less
theologians of the present times ⁴⁰.

Yet neither the emperor nor the primate of the East were dis-
posed to obey the mandate of an Italian priest; and a synod of the
Catholic‚ or rather of the Greek church, was unanimoussy demanded
as the sole remedy that could appease or decide this ecclefiastical
quarrel⁴¹. Ephesus, on all fides acceffible by sea and land, was

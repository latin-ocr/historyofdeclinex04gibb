From thence, tracing as it were a double path, it spread to
the East, over Syria, Perfia, and the Indices, and penetrated to the
west, along the coast of Africa, and over the continent of Europe.
In the spring of the second year, Constantinople‚ during three or
four months, was vifited by the pestilence : and Procopius, who ob-
served its progress and symptoms with the eyes of a phyfician⁸⁹, has
emulated the sszill and diligenee of Thucydides in the description of
the plague of Athens⁹³. The infectior] was sometimes announced
by the visione of a distempered fancy, and the viritim despaired as
soon as he had heard the menace and felt the stroke of an invisible
speehe. But the greater number, in their beds, in the streete, in
their usual occupation, were surprised by a ssight fever; so ssight
indeed, that neither the pulse nor the colour of the patient gave any
figns of the approaching danger. The same, the next, or the suc-
ceeding day, it was deelared by the swelling of the glands, particu-
larly those of the groin, of the arm-pits, and under the ear3 and
when these bubos or tumours were opened, they were found to
contain a coal, or black substance, of the fize of a lentil. If they came
to a just swelling and suppuration, the patient was saved by this
kind and natural discharge of the morbid humour. But if they con·-

⁸⁹ Dr. Freind (Hist. Medicin. in Opp.
p. 416—420. Lond. 1733.) is satisfied that
Procopius must have studied physic from his
knowledge and use of the technical words.

Yet many words that are now scientific, were
common and popular in the Greek idiom.

nounced in St. Mark's library by Fabius Paul-
linus Utinensis, a phyfician and philosopher.

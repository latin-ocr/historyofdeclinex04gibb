unbounded ambition of Justinian. Yet the same error was repeated,
the same consequences were felt, and the Goths, both of Italy and
Spain, insensible of their approaching danger, beheld with indiffer-
ence, and even with joy, the rapid downfal of the Vandals. After
the failure of the royal line, Theudes, a valiant and powerful chief,
ascended the throne of Spain, which hc had formerly administered
in the name of Theodorie and his infant grandson. Under his com-—
mand, the Vifigoths besieged the fortress of Ceuta on the African
coast: but, while they spent the sabbath-day in peace and devotion,
the pious security of their camp was invaded by a sally from the
town3 and the king himself, with some difficulty and danger, escaped
from the hands of a sacrilegious enemy⁴⁶. It was not long before
his pride and resentment were gratified by a suppliant embaffy from
the unfortunate Gelimer, who implored‚ in his distress‚ the aid of the
Spaniss1 monarch. But instead of sacrificing these unworthy paffions
to the <linares of generofity and prudence‚ Theudes amused the
ambaffadors, till he was secretly informed of the loss of Carffiage,

. and then dismiffed them with obscure and. contemptuous advice, to

seek in their native country a true knowledge 'of the state of the
Vandals⁴⁷. The long continuance of the Italian war delayed the
punishment of the Vifigoths ; and the Q of Theudes were closed
before they tasted the fruits of his mistaken policy. After his death,
the sceptre of Spain was disputed by a civil war. The weaker can-
didate solicited the proteilion of justinian, and ambitioussy subscribed
a treaty of aniame, Which deeply wounded the independence and
happiness of his country. Several cities, both on the ocean and the
Mediterranean, were ceded to the Roman troops, who afterwards

k-g-w—-ae guised his terror by the name of suspicion, and his servants con-

cealed their dissoyalty under the mask of fear, Bahram alone dis-
played his undaunted courage and apparent fidelity: and as soon as
he found that no more than twelve thousand soldiers would follow
him against the enemy, he prudently declared, that to this fatal
number heaven had reserved the honours of the triumph. The steep

band of resolute men might overwhelm with stones and darts the
myriads of the Turkissi host : their emperor and his son were trans-

report, that Bahram had privately retained the most precious fruits
of his Turkisn victory. But the approach of a Roman army on the

applaud 3 and the toils of lla-hrain were rewarded with the permis-
sion of encountering a new enemy, hy their skill and discipline

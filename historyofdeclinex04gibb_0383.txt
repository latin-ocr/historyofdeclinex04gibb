OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Insufficient remedies followed with distant and tardy steps the
rapid progress of the evil. The ancient worship of rthe Romans af-
forded a peculiar goddess to hear and reconcile the complaints of a
married life3 but her epithet of Virt‘placcz'w, the appenser of hus-
bands, too clearly indicates on which fide submiffion and repentance
were always expedied. Every affl: of a citizen was subje& to the

affigned, at their command, the motives of his conducit ¹²⁷3 and a
senator was expelled for dismiffing his virgin spouse without the
knowledge or advice of his friends. Whenever an aetion was in-
stituted for the recovery of a marriage-portion, the prcelor, as the
guardian of equity, examined the cause and the characiers, and
gently inclined the scale in favour of the guiltless and injured party.

The presence of seven Roman witneffes was required for the validity
of this solemn and deliberate act: if any adequate provocation had
been given hythe husband, instead of the delay of two years, he
was compelled to refund immediately, or in the space of six months;
but if he could arraign the manners of his wife, her guilt or levity
was expiated by the loss of the fixth or eighth part of her marriage-
portion. The Ghristian princes were the first who specified the just
causes of a private divorce ; their institutions‚ from Constantine to
Justinian, appear to fluituate between the eustom of the empire

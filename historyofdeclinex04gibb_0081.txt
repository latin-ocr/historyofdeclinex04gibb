OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

As fill< became of indispensable use, the emperor Justinian saw,
with concern, that the Pei-flans had occupied by land and sea the
monopoly of this important supply, and that the wealt'n of his sub-
jects was continually drained by a nation of enemies and idolaters.
An affive government would have restored the trade of Egypt and
the navigation of the Red Sea, which had decayed with the pro-
sperity of the empire; and the Roman veffels might have sailed,
for the purchase of mk, to the ports of Ceylon, of Malam, or even
of China. Justinian embraced a more humble expedient, and soli-
cited the aid of his Christian allies, the AEthiopians of Abyffinia‚ who
had recently acquired the arts of navigation‚ the spirit of trade, and
the sea-port of Adulis⁷³‚ still decoratcd with the trophies of a Gre-
cian conqueror. Along the African coast, they penetrated to the
equator in search of gold, emeralds, and aromatics ς but they wisely
declined an unequal competition‚ in which they must be always prc-
vented by the vicinity of the Pei'fians to the markets of India ; and
the emperor submitted to the disappointment, till his wishes were
gratified by an unexpested event. The gospel had been preached
<to the Indians: a bishop already governed the Christians of St.
Thomas on the pepper-coast of Malabar; a church was planted in
Ceylon, and the miffionaries pursued the footsteps of commerce to
the extremities of Afian. Tvvo Persian monks had long refided in
China, perhaps in the royal city of Nankin, the seat of a mo-
narch addicied to foreign superststions, and who a&ually received
an embaffy from the isse of Ceylon. Amidst their pious occupa-
tions, they viewed with a curious eye the common dress of the

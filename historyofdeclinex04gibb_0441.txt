OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

but his genuine treasure consisted in the praefice of liberal oeconomy,
and the contempt of all vain aud superfluous expence. The Romans
of the East would have been happy, if the best gift of heaven, a
patriot king, had been confirmed as a proper and permanent blessing.
But in less than four years after the death of Justin, his worthy suc-
ceffor sunk into a mortal disease, which left him only sufficient time
to restore the diadem, according to the tenure by which he held it,
to the most deserving of his fellovv-citizens. He selecsted Maurice
from the crowd, a judgment more precious than the purple it-
self: the patriarch and senate were summoned to the bed of the
dying prinee: he bestowed his daughter and the e1npire3 and his
last· advice was soleninly delivered by the voice of the quaestor,
Tiberius expreffed his hope, that the virtues of his son and succeffor
would ere& the noblest mausoleum to his memory. His memory
was embalmed by the public afflidtion3 but the most sincere grief
evaporates in the tumult of a new reign, and the eyes and accla-

mations of mankind were speedily directed to the rising sun.

The emperor Maurice derived his origin from ancient Rome²⁹;

but his immediate parents were settled at Arabiffus in Cappadocia,
and their singular felicity preserved them alive to behold and par-
take the fortune of their augzst son. The youth of Maurice was
spent in the profession of arms; Tiberius promoted him to the
command of a new and favourite legion of twelve thousand confede-
rates; his valour and conduct were fignalized in the Persian war;
and he returned to Constantinople to accept, as his just reward, the
inheritance of the empire⁴ Maurice ascended the throne at the
mature age of forty-three years3 and he reigned above twenty years

²⁹ It is therefore singular enough that Paul Latin provinces of Europe; and a various
(l. iii. c. ις.) should distinguish him as the reading, in Graecorum Imperio, would apply
first Greek emperor—primus ex Graecorum the expression to the empire rather than ¹120

southez n piles, a balustrade, te1minated on either side by the thrones
of the emperor and the patriarch, divided the nave from the choir:
and the space, as far as the steps of the altar, was occupied by the
cicrgy and fingers. The altar itself, a name which insenfibly be-
came familiar to Christian ears, was placed in the eastern recess, ar·-

tificially built in the form of a demi-cylinder3 and this sanfiuary
communicated 'oy several dom-s with the sacri'sty, the vestry, the

,baptisterffi and the contiguous buildings, subservient either to the

pomp of worship, or the private use of the ecclesiastical ministers.
The memory of past calamities inspired Justinian with a wife reib-

the new edifice3 and the choice of the materials was applied to the
strength, the lightness, or the splend'our of the respec‘five parts. The
solid' piles which sustained the cupola were composed of huge blocks
of freestone‚ ‹hewn into squares and triangles, fortified by circles of

substance, which consiste either of pumice-stone that floats in the
water, or of bricks from the isse of Rhodes, five times less ponderous
than the ordinary sort. The whole frame of the edifice was con-
strufied of brick ; but those base materials were concealed by a crust
of marble ; and the infide of St. Sophia, the cupola, the two larger,
and the six smaller, semi-domes, the walls, the hundred columns,
and the pavement, delight even the eyes of Barbarians, with a rich

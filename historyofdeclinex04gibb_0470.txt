hostile fleet ⁶, and seventy thousand captives were transplanted from
Hyrcania to the isse of Cyprus. On the return of spring, Justinian
descended into the fertile plains of Assyria, the flames of war ap-
proached the refidenee of Nussiirvan, the indignant monarch sunl<
into the grave, and his last edi& restrained his succeffors from ex-

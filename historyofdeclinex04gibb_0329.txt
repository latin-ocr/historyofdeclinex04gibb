ton’s muse had so recently adorned, that the comet “ from its
“ horrid hair ssiakes pestilence and war ⁸¹.” Its road in the heavens
was observed with exquisite ikill by Flamstead and Caffini; and
the mathematical science of Bernoulli, Nevvton, and HaHey, in-
vestigated the laws of its revolutions. At the ezghth period, in the
year two thousand three hundred and fifty—five, their calculatione.
may perhaps be verified by the astronomers of some future capital
in the Siberian or American wilderness.

II. The near approach of a comet may injure or destroy the globe
which we inhabit3 but the changes on its surface have been hitherto
produced by the aetion of vulcanos and earthquakes⁸². The nature
of the soil may indicate the countries most exposed to these formid-
able concuffions‚ fince they are caused by subterraneous fires, and

such fires are kindled by the union and fermentation of iron and
sulphur. But their times and effeets appear to lie beyond the
reach of human curiosity, and the philosopher will discreetly abstain
from the prediction of earthquakes, till he has counted the drops of
water that filently filtrate on the infiammable mineral, and measured
the caverns which encrease by refistance the explofion of the im·-
prisoned air. Without affigning the cause, history will distinguilh
the periods in which these calamitous events have been rare or fre-
quent, and will observe, that this fever of the earth raged with

uncommon violence during the reign of Justinian8 . Each year is

⁸¹ paradise Lost was published in the year
16673 and the famous lines (l. ii. 708, δια),
which startled the licenser, may allude to the
recent comet of 1664, observed by Caffini at
Rome in the presence of queen christina
(Fontenelle, in his Eloge‚ tom. v. p. 338.).
Had charles II. betrayed any symptoms of
curiosity or sear?

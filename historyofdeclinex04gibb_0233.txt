In a studied oration, he imparted to the senate his resolution to diffem- u--v—-a

ble the insult‚ and· to purchase the friendlhip of the¹ Avars 3 and the
whole senate, like the mandarins of China, applauded the incompara-
ble wisdom and-forefight of their sovereign‚ The instruments of luxury
were immediately prepared to captivate the Barbarians; filken gar-
merus, soft and splendid beds, and chains and collars incrusted with
gold. The ambaffadors, content with such liberal reception, de·-
parted from. Constantinople‚ and valentin, one of the emperor’s
guards, was sent with a fimilar character to their camp at the foot
of mount Caucasus. As their destruction or their success must» be
alike advantageous to the empire, he persuaded them* to invade the
enemies of Rome3 and they were easily tempted, by gifts and pro-
mises, to gratify their ruling inclinatione. These fugitives who fied
before the Turkiffl arms, passed the Tanais and Borysthenes, and
boldly advanced into the heart of Poland and Germany, violating
the law of nadons, and abuling the rights of victory. Before ten
years had elapsed, their campe were seated on the Danube and the
Elbe, many Bulgarian and Sclavonian names were obliterated from
t-hc earth, and the remainder of their tribes are found, as tributaries
and vaffass, under the standard of the Avars. The chagan, the pe-
culiar title of their king, still affected to cultivate the friendssiip of
the emperor-3¹ and Justinian entertained some thoughts of fixing
them in Pannonia to balance the prevailing power of the Lombards..
But the virtue or treachery of· an Avar betrayed the secret enmity
and ambitious defigns of their countrymen 3- and they loudly com,-
plained of the fimid, though jealous policy, of detaining their am-
baffadors, and denying the arms which they had. been allowed to
purchase in the capital of the empire³⁴.

THE DECLINE AND FALL
Chaldean philosophy ⁶, the Jews ⁷ were persuaded of the pre-⁴

existence, transmigration, and immortality of souls; and Providence
was justified by a supposition, that they were confined in their
earthly prisons⁴to expiate the stains which they had contraCoed in a

former state ⁸2 But the degrees of purity and corruption are almost
immeasurable. It might be fairly presumed, that the most sublime
and virtuous of human spirits was infused into the offspring of Mary
and the'Holy Gh0st⁹; that his abasement was the r'esult of his

voluntary'choice3 and that the objetst of his miffion was, to purify,¹
not his own, but the sins of the world. On his return to his native·
fides, he received the immense reWard of his obedience3 the ever-

’ lasting kingdom of the Meffiah, which had been darkly foretold by the

prophets‚ under the carnal images of peace, of conquest, and-of do-'
minion. Omnipotence could enlarge the human facolties of Christ
to the extent of his caelestial office. In the language of antiquity,
the title of God' has not been severely confined to the first parent,⁴
and his incomparable minister, his only begotten Son, might claim,

without presumption, the religious‚ though secondary, worssiip of a
subje& world„

⁶ The metaphyfics of the soul are disen-

istence, before their union with the body„
gaged by Cicero (Tusculan. l. i.) and Maxi-

3. That they have been propagated from the

mus of Tyre (Dissertat. xvi.) from the intri-
cacies of dialogue, which sometimes amuse
and often perplex, the readers ofthe Phae-
drus, the Phaedon, and the Laws of Plato.

⁷ The discipies of Jesus were persuaded
that a man might have smned before he was
born (John, ix. 2.), and the Pharisees held
the transmigration of virtuous souls (Joseph.
de'ssell. judaice, l. ii. c. 7.) ;v and a modern
Rabbi is modestly ass'ured that Hermes, Py-
diagoras, Plato, ὅτε. derived their metaphy-
stcs from his illustrious countrymen.

²³ Four different opinions have been euter-
tained concerning the origin of human souls.
ι. That th'ey are eternal and divine. z. That

they were created, in a separate state of ex-

original stock of Adam, who contained in

‚ himself the mental as well as the corporeaL

seed of his posterity. 4. That each sou} is
occafionally created and embodied in the
moment of conception.—The last of these
sentiments appears to have prevailed among·
the moderns3 and our spizituel history is
grown less sublime, without becoming more·
intelligible.

one of the fifteen herclies imputed to Origen-

Rabbis attribute one and the same foul to
the persons of Adam, David, and the Mes-

ssah.

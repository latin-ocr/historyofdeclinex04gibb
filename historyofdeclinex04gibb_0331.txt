OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

many a youth was lost in the earthquake, who might have lived to
100 the scourge or the guardian of his country. In these distasters‚
the architect becomes the enemy of mankind. The hut of a savage,
01· the tent of an Arab, may be thrown down without injury to the
inhabitant3 and the Peruvians had reason to deride the folly of their
Spanish conquerors, who with so much eost and labour erected their

the virtue or repentance of individuale, an affrighted people is more

less destructive to mankind in their death than in their lives. The

and his successor-5⁸²³, first appeared in the neighbourhood of Pelu—

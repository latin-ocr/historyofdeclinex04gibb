his eagles; the natione were oppreffed by their own fears, and the
invincible legions which he commanded, had been formed by the
habits of conquest and the discipline of ages. In this view, the
character of Belisarius may be deservedly placed above the heroes
of the ancient republics. His imperfeetions flowed from the con-
tagion of the times ; his virtues were his own, the free gift of 11:20-
ture or refle&ion; he raised himself without a master or a rival;
and so inadequate were the arms committed to his hand, that his
sole advantage was derived from the pride and presumption of his
adversaries. Under his command, the subjects of Justinian often
deserved to be called Romans: but the unwarlike appellation of
Greeks was imposed as a term of reproach by the haughty Goths ς
who affe-§ted to blush, that they must dispute the kingdom of Italy
with a nation of tragedians, pantomimes, and pirates³. The climate
of Afia has indeed been found less congenial than that of Europe,

regular force of the empire had once amounted to fix hundred and

to one hundred and fifty thousand; and this number, large as it
may seem, was thinlv scattered over the sea and land; in Spain
and Italy, in Africa and Egypt, on the banks of the Danube, the
coast of the Euxine, and the frontiers of Persia. The citizen was

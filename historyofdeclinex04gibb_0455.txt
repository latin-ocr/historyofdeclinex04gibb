or THE ROMAN niumm.

Amidst the arms of the Lombards, and under the despotism 0f the
Greeks, we again enquire into the fate of Rome ⁵³, which had
reached, about the close of the fixth century, the lowest period of
her depreffion. By the removal of the seat of empire, and the suc—
ceffive loss of the provinces, the sources of public and private opn-
lence were exhausted3 the lofty tree, under whose {hade the nations
of the earth had reposed, was deprived of its leaves and branches,
and the sapless trunk was left to wither on the ground. Thc mi-
nisters of command, and the meffengers of viel-ory, no longer met
on the Appian or Flaminiam way; and the hostile approach of the
Lombards was often felt and continually feared. The inhabitants
of a potent and peaceful capital, who vifit without an anxious
thought the garden of the adjacent country, will faintly pic‘ture in
their fancy the distress of the Romans: they shut or opened their

gates with a trembling hand, beheld from the walls the flames of
their houses, and heard the lamentations of their brethren who were

coupled together like dogs, and dragged away into distant ssavery
beyond the sea and the mountains. Such incessant alartns must an-
nihilate the pleasures and interrupt the labours of a rural life 3 and
the Campagna of Rome was speedily reduced to the state of a dreary
wilderness, in which the land is barren, the waters are impure, and
the air· is infetffious. Curiofity and ambition no longer attracted
the nations to the capital of the world: but if chance or neceffity
directed the steps of a wandering stranger, he contemplated with
horror the vacancy and solitude of the city, and might be tempted
to ask, where is the senate, and where are the pcople. In a season

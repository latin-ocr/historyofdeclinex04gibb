emperor was diffused over the Holy Land3 and if reason should
condemn the monasteries of both sexes which were built or restored
by Justinian, yet charity must applaud the wells which he sunk, aud

which, from the doors perhaps, or the roos, was surnamed chalce,
or the brazen. The dome of a spacious quadrangle was supported
by maffy pillars; the pavement and walls were incrusted with many-
coloured marbles—the emerald green of Laconia, the fiery red, and
the white Phrygian stone interseded with veins of a sea-green hue:
the mosaic paintings of the dome and fides represented the glories

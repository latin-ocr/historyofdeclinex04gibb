THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H< A Ρ· The Perfian army, which had been assembled in the plains of Baby-

·...w lon, prudently declined the strong cities of Mesopotamia, and fol-

[owed the western bank of the Euphrates, till the small though>
populous town of Dura presumed to arrest the progress of the·
great king. The gates of Dura, by treachery and surprise, were
burst open3 and as soon as Chosroes had stained his scymiter with

the blood of the inhabitants, he dismissed the ambaffador of Justi- Α ‚h

nian to inform his master in what place he had left the enemy of
the Romans. The conqueror still affected the praise of humanity

and justice; and as he beheld a noble matron with her infant rudely , ·

divine justice to punish the author of these calamities. Yet the·
herd of twelve thousand captives was ransomed for two hundredi
pounds of gold3 the neighbouring bilhop of Sergiopolis pledged'·
his' faith for the payrnent; and in the subsequent year the unfeeling*
avariee of Chosroes exaaed the penalty of an obligation which it:
was generous to contra& and impoffible to discharge. He advanced'

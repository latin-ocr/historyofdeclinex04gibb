h-v—-t legal sentence, without any royal mandate, the patriarch, at the

dawn of day, led a seditious multitude to the attack of the syna-
gogues. Unarmed and unprepared, the Jews were incapable of
refistance3 their houscs of prayer were levelled with the ground,
and the episcopal warrior, aftcr rewarding his troops with the plun-

THE DECLINE AND FALL

august ceremony has been commemorated by the annual feffival of
the exaltation of the crosS. Before the emperor presumed to tread
the consecrated round, he was instrueted to strip himself of the
diademtand purip , the pomp and vanity of the world: but in the
judgment of his clergy, the persecution of the Jews was more easily
reconciled with the precepts of the gospel. He again ascended his
throne to receive the congratulations of the ambaffadors of France
and India: and the fame of Moses, Alexander, and Hercules ¹¹²⁵,
was eclipsed, in the popular estimation, by the superior merit and
glory of the great Heraclius. Yet the deliverer of the East was in-
digent and feeble. Of the Pei-fian spoils, the most valuable portion
had been expended in the war, distributed to the soldiers‚ or buried,
by an unlucky tempest‚ in the waves of the Euxine. The con-
science of the emperor was oppreffed by the obligation of restoring

the wealth of the clergy, which he had borrowed for their own de—
fence : a perpetual fund was required to satisfy these inexorable cre-
ditors ; the provinces, already wasted by the arms and avarice of the
Peffians, were compelled to a second payment of the same taxes ς
and the arrears of a fimple citizen, the treasurer of Damascus, were
commuted to a fine of one hundred thousand pieces of gold. The

⁸ loss of two hundred thousand soldiers¹¹³ who had fallen by the

s'word, was of less fatal importance than the decay of arts, agricul—
ture, and population, in this long and destructive war: and although

ι «α νὶἃοι·ὶοι]3 army had been formed under the standard of Heraclius„

the unnatural effort appears to have exhausted rather than ex-
ercised their strength. While the emperor triumphed at Constanti·

the time, the thing itself must be restored to the owner with an ad-
ditional reward for the beneficial occupatiori and employment. ln
these lucrative contradis, to which may be added those of partnerffiip
and commiffions, the civilians sometimes imagine the delivery of the
object, and sometimes presume the consent of the parties. The sub-
stantial pledge· has been refined into the invifible rights of a mortgage
or hypotheca ; and the agreement of sale, for a certain price, imputes,

from that moment, the chauces of gain or loss to the account of the -’

purchaser. It may be fairly supposed, that every man will obey the
diciates of his interest ; and if he accepts the benefit, he is obliged
to sustain the expence‚ of the transaction. In this boundless subject,

of the one and the interest of the other, as they materially affe&

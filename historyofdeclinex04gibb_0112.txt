They
dismissed their royal captive aster he had submitted to adore the
majesty of a Barbarian3 and the humiliation was poorly evaded by
the casuistical subtility of the Magi, who instructed Perozes to dire&
his intention to the rising sun. The indignant suceeffor of Cyrus
forgot his danger and his gratitude; he renewed the attack with
headstrong fury, and lost both his army and his life ¹³⁵. The death
of Perozes abandoned Perssa to her foreign and domestic enemies3
and twelve years of confufion elapsed before his son Cabades or

Kobad could embrace any defigns of ambition or revenge. The un-
kind parfimony of Anastasius was the motive or pretence of a Ro-
man war¹³⁶3 the Huns and Arabs marched under the Perfian stan-

dard, and the fortifications of Armenia and Mesopotamia were, at

that time, in a ruinous or imper-fe& condition. The emperor re-

turned his thanks to the governor and people of Martyropolis, for
the prompt surrender of a city which could not be successfully de-
fended‚ and the conflagration of Theodosiopolis might justify the
condu& of their prudent neighbours. Amida sustained along and
destructive stege ι at the end of three months, the loss of fifty thou-
sand of the soldiers of Cabades was not balancedby any prospe&
of success, and it was in vain that the Magi deduced a flattering
prediCtion from the indecency of the women on the ramparts,

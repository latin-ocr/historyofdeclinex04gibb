summoned to undergo this important examination, and after a pause
of silent rapture, he hailed her as the queen of Italy, and humbly
requested, that, according to the custom of the nati0n‚ ssie would

’ present a cup of wine to the first of her new subjects. By the com-

mand οἱ her father, she obeyed: Autharis received the cup in his turn,
and, in restoring it to the princess, he secretly touched her hand,
and drew his own finger over his face and lips. In the evening,
Theudclinda imparted to hei· nurse the indiscreet familiarity of the
strangcr, and was comforted by the affurance, that such boldness
could proceed only from the king her husband, who, by his beauty
and courage, appeared worthy of her love. The ambaffadors were
dismissed: no sooner did they reach the confines of Italy, than
Autharis, raislng himself on his horse, darted his battle-axe against
a tree with incomparable strength and dexterity, ‘⁶ Such,'’ said he
to the astonished Bavarians, “ such are the strokes of the king of the
“ Lombards‚” On the approach of a French army, Garibald and
his daughter took refuge in the dominions of their ally; and the
marriage was consummated in the palace of Verona. At the end of
one year, it was diffolved by the death of Autharis: but the virtues
of Theudelinda ⁵¹ had endeared her to the nati0n‚ and she was per-
mitted to bestow, with her hand, the sceptre of the Italian kingdom.

From this fact, as well as from similar events⁵²‚ it is certain that
the Lornbards poffeffed freedom to ele& their sovereign‚ and sense to
decline the frequent use of that dangerous privilege. The public
revenue arose from the produce of land, and the profits of justice.

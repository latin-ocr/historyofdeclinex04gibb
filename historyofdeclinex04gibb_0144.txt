140 THE DECLINE AND FALL

μην-ζ..) eve of St. Cyprian, when the churches were already adorned and
illuminated for the festival of the martyr, whom three centuries of
superstition had almost raised to a local deity. The Arians, con-
seious that their reign had expired, resigned the temple to the Ca-
tholics, who rescued their saint from profane hands, performed the
holy sites, and loudly proclaimed the creed of Athanasius and Justi-

aperture in the wall, the sails of the Roman fieet. After their sepa-
ration from the army, the naval commanders had proceeded with

montory, and obtained the first intelligence of the vietory of Belisa-

ever, the rash attempt of forcing the chain of the port; and the ad-
jacent harbour and suburb of Mandracium were insulted only by
the rapine of a private officer who disobeyed and deserted his leaders.
But the Imperial fieet, advancing with a fair wind, steered through
the narrow entrance of the Goletta, and occupied in the deep and ca.
pacious lake of Tunis a secure station about five miles from the capi-

tal ¹⁹. No sooner was Belisarius informed of their arrival, than he

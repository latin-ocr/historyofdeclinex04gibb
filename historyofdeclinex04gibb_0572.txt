sacred landmarks which had been sixed at Nice, (Ionstantinople, and
Ephesus, according to the rule of scripture and tradition. At length
they yielded to the importunities of their masters, but their infal-
lible decree, vafter it had been ratified with deliberate votes and vehe-
ment acclamations, was overturned in the next seffion by the oppo-
fition of the legates and their Oriental friends, It was in vain that
a multitude of episcopal voices repeated in chorus, “ The definitioni of
“ the fathers is orthodox and immutable! The heretics are now
“ discovered lAnathema to the Nestorians! Let them depart from

In the name of the fourth general couneil, the Christ in one person,
but in two natm-es, was announced to the Catholic world: an intvi-

doetrine, already varniffied with the rust of antiquity, was admitted

supremacy ofthe Roman pontiff. The synod of Chalcedon still triumphs
in the protestant churches; but the ferment of controversy has subfided‚
and the most pi'ous Christians of the present day are ignorant 017
careless of their own belief concerning the mystery of the incarnation..

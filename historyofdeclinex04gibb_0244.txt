THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A Ρ· should be found possible to execute an entire version of Plato and

XLH.

k--w——u Aristotle in a foreign dialect, which had not been framed to express

the spirit of freedom and the subtleties of philosophie disquisltion.
And, ifthe reason of the Stagyrite might be equally dark, or equally
intelligible in every tongue, the dramatie art and verbal argumentation

of the diseiple of Socrates⁵⁴, appear to be indissolubly mingled with ·

the grace and perfeetion of his Attie style. In the'seareh of universal
knowledge, Nulhirvan was informed, that the moral and politieal
fables of Pilpay‚ an ancient Brachman, were preserved with jealous
reverenee among the treasures of the kings of India. The phyfieian
Perozes was seeretly dispatehed to the banks of the Ganges, with

instruetions to proeure, at any price, the communication of this
valuable work. His dexterity obtained a transcript‚ his learned di·-
ligenee aeeomplished the transsation3 and the sables of Pilpay³⁵ were
read and admired in the affernbly of Nussiirvan and his nobles.
The Indian original, and the Persian copy, have long smee disap-
peared: but this venerable monument has been saved by the cu-
riosity of the Arabian ealiphs, revived in the modern Perfic, the
Turkish, the Syriae, the Hebrew, and the Greek idionis, and trans-
fused through succeffive versions into the modern languages of
Europe. In their present form, the peculiar character, the manners
and religion of the Hindoos, are completely obliterated ς’ and the

intrinfic merit of the fables of Pilpay is far inferior to the concise

and Jones (p. 153—185.): <²7³4 w· φλωτἾῃ
και upa-weram, is the character which Agathias
(l. ii. p. 66.) ascribes to an idiom renowned
in the East for poetieal sostncss.

⁵⁴ Agathias specifies the Gorgias, Phaedon,
Parmenides, and Timaeus. Renaudot (Fabri-
cius,Bibliot.Graec. torn.xii. p.2.}6 —261 .) does
not mention this Barbarie version of Aristotle.

⁵⁵ Of these fables, {have seen three copies
in three different languages: ι. In Greek,
transsated by Simeon Seth (A. D. 1100.)

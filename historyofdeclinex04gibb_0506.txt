μων-,ι But the provinces, which had been fassiioned by the habits of six

hundred years to the virtues and vices of the Roman government,
supported. with relu&ance the yoke of the Barbarians. The idea of
a republic was kept alive by the institutions, or at least by the writ-
ings, of the Greeks and Romans, and the subjecis of Heraclius had
been educated to pronounce the words of liberty and law. But it
has always been the pride and policy of Oriental princes, to display
the titles and attributes of vtheir omnipotence 3 to upbraid a nation
of ssaves with their true name and abjecZ‘c condition, and to enforce,
by cruel and insolent ffireais, the rigour of their absolute commands.
The Christians of the East were scandalized by the worship of fire,
and the impious doeirine of the two principles : the Magi were not
less intolerant than the bsthops, and the martyrdom of some native
Perlians, who had deserted the religion of Zoroaster ⁶³, was con-
ceived to be the prelude of a fierce and general persecution. By
the oppreflive laws of Justinian, the adversaries of the church were
made the enemies of the state ; the alliance of the Jews, Nestoi-iaus,
and Jacobites, had contributed to the success of Chosroes, and his
partial favour to the sediaries provoked the hatred and fears of the
Catholic clergy. Conscious of their fear and hatred, the Persian
conqueror governed his new subjeCrs with an iton sceptre3 and as if

- he suspected the stability of his dominion, he exhausted their wealth

by exorbitant tributes and licentioris rapine, despoiled or demolissied
the temples of the East, and transported to his hereditary realms the
gold,⁷the filver, the precious marbles, the arts, and the artists of the
Afiatic cities. In the obscure pieiure of the calamities of the em·-

publithed in those of the viith general coun- from the Persian to ilie Roman army, became
cil, from whence Batonius (Annal. Eccles. a monk at Jerusalem, and insulted the wor-
A. D. 614, 626, 627.) and Butler (Lives of ss1ip os the Magi, which was then established
the Saltus, vol. i. p. 242-248.) have taken at caesarca in l'alessine.

284 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {IL [²121ss- An officerv in whom Belisarius confided was sent from Ravenna to '¹

u-wqa hasten and condu& the succours; but the meffage was neglec'ted‚ 1
and the messenger was detained at Constantinople by an advan- ’1
tageous marriage. After his patience had been exhausted by delay

 

and disappointment, the Roman general repaffed the Hadriatic, and ⁷
expedied at Dyrrachium the arrival of the troops, which were ssowly 'f‘

which escaped the Barbarians were seized by a rapacious governor, ἵ
who'imparted a scanty sustenance to the soldiers‚ and sold the re·-
mainder to the wealthy Romans. The medimnus, or fifth part of Ι q
the quarter of wheat, was exchanged for seven pieces of gold3 fifty

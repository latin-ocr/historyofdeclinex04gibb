proudly number Sogdiana, and even Serica, among the provinces of
his empire, but his real dominion was bounded by the Oxus; and
his useful intercourse with the Sogdoites, beyond the river, depended
on the pleasure of their conquerors, the white Huns, and the Turks,
who succeflively reigned over that industrious people. Yet the most
savage dominion has not extirpated the seeds of agriculture and

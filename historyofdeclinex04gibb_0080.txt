THE DECLINE AND FALL

ι--Η Sumatra and the opposite peninsula, are faintly delineated⁷¹ as the

regions of gold and silver3 and the trading cities named in the
geography of Ptolemy‚ may indicate, that this wealth was not solely
derived from the mines. The dire& interval between Sumatra
and Ceylon is about three hundred leagues ; the Chinese and lndian
navigatore. were conducted by the ssight of birds and periodical
winds‚ and the ocean might be securely traversed in square-built
ssiips, which, instead of iron, were sewed together with the strong
thread of the cocoa-nut. Ceylon, Serendib, or Taprobana, was
divided between two hostile princes3 one of whom poffeffed the
mountains, the elephante, and the lnminous carbuncle, and the other
enjoyed the more solid siches of domestic industry, foreign trade,
and the capacious harbour of Trinquemale, which received and
dismissed the fieets of the East and West. In this hospitable isse, at an
equal distance (as it was computed) from their respective countries,
the filk merchants of China, who had collee‘oed in their voyages
aloes, cloves, nutmcg, and santa] wood‚ maintained a free and
beneficial commerce with the inhabitants of the Persian gulf. The
subjecits of the great king exalted, without a rival, his power and
magnificence3 and the Roman, who confounded their vanity by
comparing his paltry coin with a gold medai of the emperor Anasta-
sius, had sailed to Ceylon‚ in an AEthiopian ship, as a {imple pas-
senger⁷².

of the countries eastward of Cape Comorin‚

say in another work ἒ) 1 may have a better

right to expatiate on the discovery and navi—

who often confound the issands of Ceylon and

Sumatur, is more clearly described by Cosmas xi

Indicopleuste53 yet even the Christian topo-
grapher has exaggerated its dimenfions. His
information on the Indian and Chinese trade
is rare and curious (l. ii. p. 138. l. xi.p. 337,
338. edit. Montfaucon).

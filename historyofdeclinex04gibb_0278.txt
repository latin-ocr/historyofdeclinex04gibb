THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A P. sperate Vandals‚ retired to the wilds of Mauritania, obtained the

*g-v--d daughter of a Barbarian prince, and eluded the pursuit of his ene·-

mies, by the report of his death. The personal weight of Beli·-
sarius, the rank, the spirit, and the temper of Germanus, the em-
peror's nephew, and the vigour and success of the second admini-

THE DECLINE AND FALL

and the Imperial edie‘cs were subscribed with alacrity or reluctance
by the four patriarchs of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and
Antioch. But the bishop and monks of Jerusalem founded the

alarm: in the languagc, or even in the silence, of the Greeks, the
Latin churches detected a latent heresy: and the obedience of pope

Honorius to the commands of his sovereign was retraeted and cen-
sured by the bolder ignorance of his succeffors. They condemned
the execrable and abominable heresy of the Monothelites, who rea
vived the errore of Manes, Apollinaris, Eutyches, &c. they figned
the sentence of excommunication on the tomb of St. Peter; the inl<
was mingled with the sacramental wine, the blood of Christ; and no
ceremony was omitted that could fill the superstitious mind with
horror and affright. As the representative of the western church,
pope Martin and his Lateran synod anathematised the perfidious
and guilty silence of the Greeks: one hundred and five bilhops of

notorious heretice, the apostates from the church, and the organa of
the devil. Such an insult under the tamest reign could not pass
with impunity. Pope Martin ended his days on the inhospitable
shore of the Taurie Chersonesus, and his oracle‚ the abbot Maximus,
was inhumanly chastised by the amputation of his tongue and his
right-hand¹⁰⁴. But the same invincible spirit survived in their suc-
ceffors, and the triumph of the Latius avenged their recent defeat,
and obliterated the disgrace of the three Chapters. The synods of

Rome were confirmed by the fixth general council of Constanti-

OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

feet of the horses ; and as new gates could not suddenly be procured,
the entrance was guardcd by a Spartan rampart of his bravest soldiers.
At the expiration of twenty-five days, Totila returned by hasty
marches from Apulia, to avenge the injury and disgrace. Belisarius
expected his approach. The Goths were thrice repulsed in three
general affaults; they lost the fiower of their troops; the royal
standard had almost fallen into the hands of the enemy, and the fame
of Totila sunk, as it had risen, with the fortune of his arms. What-
ever ikill and courage could atchieve, had been performed by the
Roman general: it remained only, that justinian should terminate,
by a strong and seasonable effort, the war which he had ambitioussy
undertaken. The indolence, perhaps the impotence, of a prince
who despised his enemies, and envied his servants, protracted the
calamities of Italy. After a long silence, Belisarius was commanded
to leave a sufficient garrison at Rome, and to transport himself into
the province of Lucania, whose inhabitants, inflamed by Catholic
zeal, had cast away the yoke of theIr Arian conquerors. In this
ignoble warfare, the hero, invincible against the power of the Bar-
barians, was basely vanquished by the delay, the disobedience, and the
cowardice of his own Officers. He reposed in his winter-quartem of
Crotona, in the full affurance, that the two paffes of the Lucanian hills

ὓ were guarded by his cavalry. They were betrayed by treachery- or

weakness ; and the rapid march of the Goths scarcely allowed time
for the escape of Belisarius to the coast of Sicily. At length a fleet
and army were affembled for the relief of Ruscianum, or Rofl'ano'ss,
a fortress fixty furlongs from the ruins of Sybaris, where the nobles
of Lucania had taken refuge. In the first attempt, the Roman forces

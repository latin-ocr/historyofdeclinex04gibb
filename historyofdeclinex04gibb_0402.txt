by a civil action of theft3 they might pass through a succeflion of
pure and innocent hands, but nothing less than a prescription of
thirty years could extinguish his original claim. They were restored
by the sentence of the praetor, and the injury was compensated by
double or threefold, or even quadruplo damages, as the deed had
been perpetrated by secret fraud or open rapine, as the robber had
been surprised in the fact or detected by a subsequent research. The
Aquilian law ¹⁶⁹ defended the living property of a citizen, his ssaves
and cattle, from the stroke of malice or negligence : the highest price
was allowed that could be ascribed to the domestic animal at any
moment of the year preceding his death3 a fimilar latitude of thirty
days was granted on the destruction of any other valuable effects.

times and the senfibility of the individual ε the pain or the disgrace

of a word or blow cannot easily be appreciated by a pecuniary
equivalent. The rude jurisprudence of the decemvirs had con—

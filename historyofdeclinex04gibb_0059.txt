oF ΤῌΕ ROMA‘N EMPIRE. 53.

Lupicina‚ or Euphemia, a Barbarian of rusticmanners, but of irre· C H A P
proachable virtue, refused to accept a prostitute for her niece3 and ι-Ξξ-α
’ even Vigilantia the superstitious mother of Justinizm, though she
acknowledged the wit and beauty of Theodora, was serioussy appre-
'henfive, lest the'levity and arrogance of that artful paramour might

corrupt the piety and happiness of her son. These obstacles were
removed by the inflexible constancy of Justinian. He patiently
expe&ed the death of the empress3 he despised the tears of his mo-
ther, who soon sunk under the weight of her afflidffion ; and a law
was promulgated in the name of the emperor Justin, which abolilhed
the rigid jurisprudence of antiquity. A glorious repentance (the
words of the ediec)- was left open for· the unhappy females who
had prostituted their persons on the theatre, and they were permit-
ted to contra& a legal union with the· most illustrious of the Ro-
mans ²⁸. This indulgence was speedily followed by the solemn
nuptials o‘f Justinian and Theodora3 her dignity was gradually ex-
alted with that of her lover ς, and, as soon as Justin had invested his
nephew ‚with the purple, the patriarch of Constantinople placed the
diadem on the heads of the emperor and empress of the East. But
the usual honours which the severity of Roman manners had allowed
to the wives· of princes, could not satisfy either the ambition of
Theodora or the fondness of Justiuian. He seated her on the
throne as an equal and independent colleague in the sovereignty of
the empire‚ and an oath of allegiance was imposed on the governors
‘of the provinces in the joint names of Justinian and Theodoram„

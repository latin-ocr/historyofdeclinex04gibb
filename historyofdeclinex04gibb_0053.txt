our esteem as a laborious and successful imitation of the Attio, or x-qXLp-J'
at least of the Afiatic writers of ancient Greece. His facts are eol-
iected from the personal experience and free conversation of a sol-
dier, a statesman, and a traveller3 his style continually aspires, and
often attains‚ to the merit of strength and elegance ; his refleStions,
more especially in the speeches, which he too frequently inserts,
contain a rich fund of political knowledge; and the historiari, ex«
cited by the genereus ambition of plealing and instrufflng postersty,
appears to disdain the prejudices of the people, and the flattery of

courts. The writings of Procopius14 were read and applauded by

5; but, although he respectfully laid them at

his contemporaries ¹
the foot of the throne, the pride of Justinian must have been wounclo
ed by the praise of an hero, who perpetually eclipses the glory of
his inactive sovereign. The conscious dignity of independence was

subdued by the hopes and fears of a ssave5 and the secretary of

borrowed from Appian the divifion of pro-
vinces and wars: the viiith book, though it
bears the name of Gothic, is a miscellaneous
and general supplement down to the spring of
the year 553, from whence it is continued
by Agathias till 559 (Pagi, critica, A.D.579.

¹4 The literary fate of Procopius has been
somewhat unlucky. 1. His books de Bello
Gothico were stolen by Leonard Aretin, and
published (Fulginii, 1470. Venet. ¹471·
apud Janson. Mattaire, Annal. Typograph.
torn. i. edit. posterior, p. 290. 304. 279.

Hist. Lat. l. iii. c. ς. and the feeble de-
sence of the Venice Giornale de Letterati,
torn. xix. p. 207.). z. His works were m uti-
lated by the first Latin transsators, Christo-

even consult the MS. of the Vatican library,
of which they were praefec‘ls (Alcman. in
Praefat. Anecdot.). 3. The Greek text was
not printed till 1607, by Hoeschelius of
Auglburgh (Dictionaire de Haste, tom. ii.
p. 782.). 4. The Paris edition was irnper-
feffly executed by Claude Maltret, a Jesuit
of Tholouse (in 1663), far distant from the
Louvre press and the Vatican MS. from
which, however, he obtained some supple-
ments. His promised commenmries, &c-
have never appeared. The Agathias of Ley-
den (¹594) has been wisely rsprinted by the
Paris editor, with the Latin version of Bona-
ventura Vulcanius, a learned interpreter
(Huet‚ p. 176.). ”

ῐεὲὶεά by the sanffity of Cyril3 and the name of EUTYCHES, his ve-
nerable friend, has been applied to the se& most adverse to the Sy-
rian heresy of Nestorius. His rival Eutyches was the abb0t‚ or
archimandrite, or superior of three hundred monks‚ but the opinions
of a fimple and illiterate recluse might have expired in the cell, where
he had ssept above seventy years, if the resentment or indiscretion of
Flavian the Byzantine pontiff, had not exposed the scandal to the
eyes of the Christian world. His domestic synod was instantly con-
vened, their proceedings were sullied with clarnour and artifice, and
the aged heretic was surprised into a seeming confeffion‚ that Christ
had not derived his body from the substance of the Virgin ΜειΓγ.
FrOm their partial decree, Eutyches appealed to a general council;‚
and his cause was vigoroussy aflerted by his godson Chrysaphius‚ the
reigning eunuch of the' palace‚ and his accomplice Dioscorus, who
had succeeded to the throne, the creed, the talents‚ and the vices

the Alexandrian patriarch again oppress'ed the freedom ofdebate: the
same spiritual and carnal weapons were again drawn from the arsenals of
Egypt; the Afiatic veterans, a band of archers, served under the orders
of Dioscorus3 and the more formidable monks, whose minds were in·—
acceffible to reason or memy, besieged the doors of the cathedral. The
general, and, as it ffiould seem‚the uuconstrained voice of the fathers,

accepted the faith and even the anathemas of Cyri15 and the heresy

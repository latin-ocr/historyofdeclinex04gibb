explored a more southern road; they traversed the mountains of ιη’-υ

Thibet, descended the streams of the Ganges or the Indus, and pa-
tiently expected‚ in the ports of Guzerat and Malabar, the annual

fleets of the West⁶⁹. But the dangers of the desert were found less
intolerable than toil, hunger, and the loss of time ; the attempt was

seldom renewed‚ and the only European who has passed that unfre-
quented way, applauds his own diligence, that, in nine months
after his departure from Pekin, he reached the mouth of the Indus.
The ocean, however, was open to the free communication of man-
kind. From the great river to the tropic of Cancer, the provinces
of China vvere subdued and civilized by the emperors of the North 3
they were filled about tlte time of the Christian aera with cities and
men, mulberry-trees and their precious inhabitant33 and if the
Chinese‚ with the knowledge of the compass, had poffeffed the
genius of the Greeks or Phoenkians, they might have spread their
discoveries over the southern hemisphere. I am not qualified to
examine, and I am not disposed to believe, their distant voyages to
the Perfian gulf or the Cape of Good Hope: but their ancestors
might equal the labours and success of the present race, and the
sphere of their! navigation might extend from the isses of Japan to
the streights of Malacca‚ the pillars‚ if we may apply that name, of
an Oriental Hercules ⁷⁰. Without lofing fight of land, they might
fail along the coast to the extreme promontory of Achin, which is
annually visited by ten or twelve ships laden with the produfflons,

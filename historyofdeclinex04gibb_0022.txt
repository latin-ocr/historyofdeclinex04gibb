1'8 THE DECLINE AND FALL

CXQXJIQXP- from whence the Gothic nation derived their origin, he maintained
2-⁴—v—-'-1 a frequent and friendly correspondence3 the Italians were clothed

in the rich sables⁴¹ of Sweden5 and one of its sovereigns, after a

voluntary or reluctant abdication‚ found an hospitable retreat in the

palace of Ravenna. He had reigned over one of the thirteen po-
pulous tribes who cultivated a small portion of the great issand or
peninsula of Scandinavia, to which the vague appellation of Thule
has been sometimes applied. That northern region was peopled, or
had been explored as high as the sixty-eighth degree of latitude‚
where the natives of the polar circle enjoy and lose the presence of
the sun at each summer and winter solstice during an equal period
of forty days⁴². The long night of his absence or death was the
mournful season of disti-ess and anxiety‚ till the meffengers who had
been sent to the mountain tops‚ descried the first rays of returning
light, and proclaimed to the plain below the festival of his resur-
re&ion⁴³.

of a Barbarian, who sheathed his sword in the pride of victory and

the vigour of his age. A reign of three and thirty years was con-

nandes, they inhabited suethans, the proper

has gradually been driven into the eastern
parts of Siberia. See Buffon (Hist. Nat.

the phoenix of ilie Edda, and the annual
death and revival of Adonis and Osiris, are
the allegorical symbols of the absence and

return of the sun in the Arc'lic regions. This
ingenious writer is a wortliy dil’ciple of the

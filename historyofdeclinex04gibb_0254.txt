THE DECLINE AND FALL'

The extreme length of the Euxine sea⁶⁵‚ from Constantinople to

the mouth of the Phasis, may be computed as a voyage of nine days, ν i· ·

and a measure of seven hundred miles. From‘the Iberian Caucasus,
the most lofty and craggy mountains of Asia, that river descends
with such oblique vehemence, that in a short space it is traversed
by one hundred and twenty bridges. Nor does the stream become
placid and navigable, till it reaches the town of Sarapana, five days
journey from the Cyrus, vvhich flows from the same hius, but in
a contrary ,direc'tiom to the Caspian lake.
rivers has suggested the praefice, or at. least the‘ idea, of wasting the
precious merchandise of India down the Oxus, over the Caspian, up
the Cyrus, and with the current of the Phasis into the Euxine and

Mediterranean seas. As it succeffively conedrs the streams of the plain

of Colchos, the Phasis moves with diminished speed, though ac- -

cumulated weight. At the mouth it is fixty fathom deep, and half
a league broad, but a small woody issand is interposed in the midst
of the charmel : the water, so soon as it has depofited an earthy or‘
metallic sediment, fioats on the surface. of the waves, and is no
longer susceptible of corruption. In a course of one hundred miles„
forty of which are navigable for large vefl'els, the Phasis divides the

celebrated region of Colchos⁶⁶‚ or Mingrelia⁶⁷, which, on three

⁶⁵ The Periphas, or circumnavigation ofthe
Euxine sea, was described in Latin by Sallust,
and in Greek by Arrian: 1. The former
work, which no longer exisss, has been re-
stored by the singular diligence of M. de
Broffes, first president of the parliament of
Dijon (Hist. de la Republique Romaine,
tom. ii. l. iii. p. 199—298.), who ventures to
assume the charaeter of the Roman historian.
His description of the Euxine is ingenioussy
formed of all the fragments os the original,
and os all the Greeks and Latins whom Sal-
lust might copy, or by whom he might be
copied ; and the merit of the execution atones

for the whimfical design. 2·. The Periplus of
Arrian is addreffed to the emperor Adrian (in
Geograph. Minor. Hudson, tom. i.), and con-
tains whatever the governor of Pontus had
seen, from Trebizond to Dioscurias; what-
ever he had heard frorn Dioscurias to the Da-
nube3 and whatever he knew from the Da-
nube to Trebizond.

⁶⁶ Bcficlcs the many occafional hints from
the poem, historiam, &c. of andquiry, we may
consult the geographical descriptions of Col- ‚
chos, by Strabo (l. xi⁴ p. 760—765.) and Pliny
(Hist. Natur. vi. ς. 19, &c.). '

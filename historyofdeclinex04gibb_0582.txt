organs of the Paraclete. On the approach of the Catholic priests
and soldiers, they grasped with alacrity 'the crown of martyrdom ;
the conventicle and the congregation periffied in the-flames, but these
primitive fanatics were not extinguissied three hundred years after
the death of their tyrant. Under the protection of the Gothic ‘coni

severity of the laws: their clergy equalled the wealth and· magni-

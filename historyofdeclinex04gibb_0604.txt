THE DECLINE AND FALL

ΙΙ. The history of the Monophylites is less copious and interesting
than that of the Nestorians. Under the reigns of Zeno and Anasta-

³³⁹ sius, their artful leaders surprised the ear of the prince, usurped the

thrones of the East, and crushed on its native soil the school of the
Syrians. The rule of the Monophysite saith was defined with ex-
quisite discretior. by Severus patriarch of Antioch3 he condemned,
in the style of the Henoficon, the adverse herefies of Nestorius and
EutycheS, maintained against the latter the reality of the body of
Christ, and constrained the Greeks to allow that he was a liar who
spoke truth¹²⁵. But the approximation of ideas could not abate the ve-
hemence of paflion; each party was the more astonissoed that their
blind antagonist could dispute on so trifiing a difference 3 the tyrant
of Syria enforced the belief of his creed, and his reign was polluted
with the blood of three hundred and fifty monks, who were ssain,
not perhaps without provocation or refistance‚ under the walls of
Apamea¹²⁶. The succeffor of Anassafius replanted the orthodox
standard in the East: Severus fled into Egypt3 and his friend, the
⁷, who had escaped from the Nestorians of Perfia,
Fifty..
four bishops were swept from their thrones, eight hundred eccle-

eloquent Xenaias¹²
was suffocated in his exile by the Melchites of Paphlagonia.

¹²⁵ (λυ ειπιιν ᾦειθαλκθης is the expreffion Of
Theodore, in his treatife of the incarnation,
p. 245. 247. as he is quoted by La Croze
(Hist. du Christianisme d'Ethiopie et d’Ar-
menie, p. 35.), who exclaims, perhaps too
hastily, “ Qel pitoyable raisonnement!'’
Renautrot has touched (Hist. Patriarch.
Alex. p. 127—138.) the Oriental accounts
of Severus; and his authentie creed may
be found in the epistle of John the Ja-
cobite patriarch of Antioch, in the κώ cen-
tury, to his brother Mennas of Alexandria
(Affeman. Bibliot. Orient. tom. ii. p. ¹3²
-14r.).

¹²⁶ Epist. Archimandritarum et Monacho-

rum Syriae Secundae ad Papam Hormisdam,
Concil. tom. v. p. 598-602. The courage
of St. Sabas, ut leo animosus, will justify
the suspicion that the arms of these monks
were not always spiritual or defensive (Baro-
nius‚ A. D. 513, Νο 7, &c.).

¹²⁷ Affemanni (Bibliot. orient. t'om. ii.
p. 10-46.) and La Croze (Christianisme
d'Ethiopie, p. 36-40.) will supply the his-
tory of Xenaias, or Philoxenus, bishop of
Mnbug, or Hierapoli5‚ in Syria. He was a
perse& master of the Syriae language, and
the author or editor of a verfion of the New
Testament.

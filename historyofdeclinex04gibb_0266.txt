202 THE DECLINE AND FALL

dable in close or in distant combat. The siege of Archaeopolis‚ a
name imposed or corrupted by the GreekS, was raised with some
loss and precipitation3 but the Perfians occupied the paffes of Iberia: ³ γ
Colchos was enssared by their forts and garrisons, they devoured the
scanty sustenanee of the people 3 and the prince of the Lazi fied into
the mountains.> In the Roman camp, faith and discipline were un-

the river, the Euxine, and a fleet of gallies. Despair united their
counsels and invigorated their arms: they withstood the affault of the
Persian33 and the flight of Nacoragan preceded or followed the
ssaughter of ten thousand of his bravest soldiers. He escaped frbm ⁴
the Romans, to fall into the hands of an unforgiving master, who

THE DECLINE AND FALL

murdcred in the baptistery. The remains of his mangled corpse
were delivered to the flames, and his ashes to the wind: and the
deed was inspired by the vifion of a pretended angc15 au ambi-
tious moult, who, under the name of Timothy the Cat⁶⁹‚ succeeded
to the place and opinions of Dioscorus. This deadly superstition
was inflamed, on either fide, by the principle and the practice of
retaliation: in the pursuit of a metaphysical quarrel, many thou-
sands ⁷⁰ were ssain, and the Christiane of every degree were deprived
of the substantial enjoyments of social life, and of the invifible gists
of baptism and the holy communion. Perhaps an extravagant fable
of the times may conceal an allegorica] picture of these fanatics‚
who tortured each other, and themselves. “ Under the consulship
‘⁴ of venantius and Celer,'' says a grave bissmp, “ the people of
“ Alexandria, and all Egypt, were seized with a strange and diaboli-
“ cal frenzy: great and small, ssaves and freedmen, monks and
“ clergy, the natives of the land, who opposed the synod of Chal-
“ cedon, lost their speech and reason, barked like dogs, and tore,

“ with their own teeth, the flesh from their hands and arms ⁷¹.”

The disorders of thirty years at length produced the famous
HENOTICON ⁷² of the emperor Zeno, which in his reign, and in
that of Anastasius, was figned by all the bishops of the East, under
the penalty of degradation and exile, if they rejected or infringed

0⁹ Anam, from his nocturnal expeditions.
In darkness and disguise he crept round the
cells of the monastery, and whispered the
revelation to his ssumbering brethren (Theo-
dor. LeCkon 1. i.).

Such is the hyperbolic language of the He-
noticon.

⁷¹ See the Chronicle of Victor Tun-
nunensm, in the LeRiones Antiqua: of Cani-

fius, republiffied by Bastuage, tom. i. p. 326.

⁷² The Henoticon is transcribed by Eva·
grius (1. iii. c· 13.)‚ and transsated by Libe-
ratus (Brev. c. ι8.). Pagi (Critica‚ tom. ii.
p. 41 ι .) and Affeman (Bibliot. Orient. tom. i.
p. 343.) are satisfied that it is free from he-
resy; but Petavius (Dogmat. Theolog. tom.v.
l. i. c. 13· p. 40.) most unaccountably affin-ms
Chalcedonensem ascivit. Anadversarywould
prove that he had never read the Henoticon.

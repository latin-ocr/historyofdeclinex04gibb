THE DECLINE AND FALL

The order of succeffion is regulated by nature, or ‘at least hythe ⁴ κε’
general &and permanent reason of the lawgiver: but this order is „f

and‘liberty of freouently violated by the arbitrary and partia] wills which prolong ‚³

testaments.

¹⁵⁰ That succeffion was the rule, testament
the exception, is proved by Taylor (Elements
of Civil *Lam p. 519—527.), a learned,
rambling, spirited, writer. ln the iid and iiin
books the method of the Institutes is doubt-
less preposterous; and the Chanccllor Du-
quess'eau (Oeuvres, tom. i. p. 275.) wishes
his countryman Domat in the place of Tri-
bonian. Yet ravenants before succffons is

not surely the natural order cf the civil lawr.

haps fabulous. At Athens a childleſs father
only could make a will (Plutarch, in Solone,
tom. i. p. 164. See lsaeus and Jones).

by Suetonius (in August. c. 101. in Neron.
c. 4.)‚ who may be ssudied as a code of Ro-
man antiquities. Plutarch (Opuscul.t0m.ii.
p. 976.) is surprised {rav δε ἒικῧηκας γραφη-ιι

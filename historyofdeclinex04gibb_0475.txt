OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, 473

the Romans, requesting them to fix a day of battle, and to chuse C gs} P,

whether they would pass the river themselves, or allow a free passage κ-,Υ-υι
to the arms of the great king. The lieutenant of the emperor
Maurice preferred the safer alternative, and this local circumstance,
which would have enhanced the victory of the perflans, rendered
their defeat more bloody and their escape more difficult. But thc
loss of his subjeets, and the danger of his kingdom, were over-

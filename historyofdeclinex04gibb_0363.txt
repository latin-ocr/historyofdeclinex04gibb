to establish his private judgment as the standard of equity: in the C H A P.
poffeffion of legissative power, he borrowed the aid of time and ΔΒΕ-ι
opinion3 and his laborious compilations are guarded by the sagos
and legissators of past times. Instead of a statue cast ina simple mould
by the h‘and of an artist, the works of Justinian represent a teffelated
pavement of antique and costly, but too often of incoherent frag-

bonian, and nine learned affociates, to revise the ordinances of his
predeceffors, as they were contained, fince the time of Hadrian, in

errors and contradiction& to retrench whatever was obsolete 01· su-

emperor to exercise an absolute jurisdi6³d0n over the works of their

composition of the DIGEST or PANDECTS⁷³, in three years, will de-

THE DECLINE AND FALL

of an injured husband, who had fignified to one of his guards the
order of his death3 but the tears of Antonina‚ and her artful se-
duffions, assured the credulous hero of her innoeence; and he
stooped, against his saith and judgment', to abandon those imprudent

Antonina, at least, continued ardent and unabated. But sear, devo-

thoughts. He dreaded the busy scandal of the capital, and the in-
discreet fondness of the wife of Belisariu33 escaped from her em-
braces, and retiring to Ephesus, {haved his head, and took refuge

A Roman accused of any capital crime might prevent the sen- C H Α Ρ-

tence of the law by voluntary exile, or death. Till his guilt had
been legally proved, his innocence was presumed, and his person
was freei till the votes of the last century had been counted and de-

His fame and fortunes were preserved, at

in every rational and sensual enjoyment, if a mind accustomed to
the ambitious tumult of Rome could support the uniformity and
filence of Rhodes or Athens. A bolder effort was required to escape
from the tyranny ofv the Caesars; but this effort was rendered
familiar by the maxims of the Stoics, the example of the bravest
Romans, and the legal encouragements of suicide. The bodies of
condemned criminals were exposed· to public ignominy, and their
children, a more serious evil, were reduced to poverty by the con-
fiscation of their fortunes. But if the victims of Tiberina and Nero
anticipated the decree of the prince 01· senate, their courage and
dispatch were recompensed by the applause of the public, the decent
honours of burial, and the validity of their testa1nents²“⁵, The
exquisite avarice and cruelty of Domitian appears to have deprived
the unfortunate of this last consolation, and it was still denied even
by the clemency of the Antonines. A voluntary death, which, in
the case of a capital offence, intervened between the accusation and
the sentence, was admitted as a confeffion of guilt, and the spoils of

the deceased were seized by the inhuman claims of the treasuryffffi

but that the lands of the Gepidae should become the sole patrimony

of the Avars. Such hard conditions were eagerly accepted by the
paffions of Alboin3 and as the Romans were diffatisfied with the

ingratitude and perfidy of the Gepidae, Justin abandoned that in-
corrigible people to their fate, and remained the tranquil 'spectator
of this unequal conflict. The despair of Cunitnund was ac‘tive and

and his liercer grandson, were assisted with advice, and money, and
troopS, by the desperate sectaries who still lurked in their native
cities of the East; their zeal was rewarded with the gift of the Ca-
tholic churches: but when those cities and churches were recoyered.
by Heraclius, their open profeffion of treason and heresy compelled

conditions which tended to enlarge and fortify the toleration of
Christianity in Persia. The emperor, ignorant of the rights of con-
science, was incapable of pity or esteem for the heretics who denied
the authority of the holy synodsz but he flattered himself that they

in Germany‚ by the superstition and policy of the most Christian
king.

The delire of gaining souls for God, and subjed'ts for the church,
has excited in every age the diligence of the Christian priests. From
the conquest of Perfia they carried their spiritual arms to the north,
the east, and the south3 and the fimplicity of the gospel was faffiioned
and painted with the colours of the Syriae theology. In the fixth

A fimilar principle dictated the Voconian law¹⁴⁷‚ which abolilhed
the right of female inheritance. As long as virgins vvere given or
sold in marriage„ the adoption of the wife extingui-(hed the hopes
of the daughter. But the equal succeffion of independent matr-ons,
supported their pride and luxury, and might transport into a foreign
house the riehes of their fathers. While the maxims of Cato ¹⁴⁸ were
revered‚ they tended to perpetuate in each family a just and vir-
tuous medi'ocrity: till female blandishments insenfibly triumphed3
and every salutary restraint was lost in the dissolute greatness of the
republic. The rigour of the decemvir-s was tempered by the equity
of the praetors. Their edic’ts restored emancipated and posthumous
children to the rights of nature3 and upon the failure of the agnats,
they preferred the blood of the cognats to the name of the gentiles,
whose title and charaoer were ,insensibly covered with oblivion.
The reciprocal inheritance of mothers and sons was establilhed in
the Tertullian and Orphitian decrees by the humanity of the senate.

A new and more impartial order was introduced by the novels of

Justinia'n, who affeeced'to revive the jurisprudence of the. twelve

defined; and each degree, according to the proximity of blood and
affeffion, succeeded to the vacant poffeffions of a Roman citizen ¹⁴⁹.

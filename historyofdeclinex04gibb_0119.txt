people. The Athenian profess'ors were paid by their dist-iplcs: ac-
cording to their mutual wants and abilities‚ the price appears to
have varied from a mina to a talent3 and Isocrates himself, who (lc-
rides the avarice of the spphists, required in his school of rhetoric,
about thirty pounds from each of his hundred pupils. The wages
of industry are just and honourable, yet the same Isocrates shed tears
at the first reeeipt of a stipend; the Stoic might blush when he was
hired to preach the contempt of money; and I should be sorry to
discover, that Aristotle οι· Plato so far degenerated from the example
of Socrates, as to exchange knowledge for gold. But some property
of lands and houses was settled by the permiffion of the laws, and
the legacies of deceased friends, on the philosophie chairs of Athens.
Epicurus bequeathed to his disciples the gardens which he had pur-
chased for eighty minae or two hundred and fifty pounds, with a
fund sufficient for their frugal subfistence and monthly festivals¹⁴⁵;
and the patrimony of Plato afforded an annual rent, which, in eight
centuries, was gradually enereased from three to one thousand pieces
of gold ¹⁴⁷. The schools of Athens were protee‘oed by the wiscst and
most virtuous of the Roman princes. The library which Hadrian
founded, was placed in a portico adorned with pi&ures, statues, and
a roof of alabaster, and supported by one hundred columns of Phry-
gian marble. The public salaries were afligned by the genereus
spirit of the Antonines3 and each professor, of politice, of rhetoric,
of the Platonic, the Peripatetic‚ the Stoic‚ and the Epicurean philo-
sophy, received an annual ssipend of ten thousand drachmae, or more

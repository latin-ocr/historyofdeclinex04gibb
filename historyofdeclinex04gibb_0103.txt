the ssmdow of the general defcnce, were compelled to guard, with
incessant vigilance, their separate habitaiions. The solitude of ancient
cities was replenished3 the new foundations of Justinian acquired‚
perhaps too hastily‚ the epitheto of impregnable and populous; and
the auspicious place of his own nativity attracied the grateful reve-

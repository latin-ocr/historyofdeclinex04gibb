OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 551

of Germanicia, and a monk of Antioch, was recommended by the C XPJINIiI P.

austerity of his life, and the eloquence of his sermons; but the first ι-Ὗ--ι
homily which he preached before the devout Theodosius betrayed the
acrimony and impatience of his zeal. “ Cive me, O Caesar,” he ex..
claimed, “ give me the earth purged of heredes, and I will give you
“ in exchange the kingdom of heaven. Exterminate with me, the
“ heretics; and with you, Iwill exterminate the Persians.” Gn the
fifth day, as if the treaty had been already ligned, the patriarch of
Constantinople discovered, sm-prit‘ed, and attacked a secret conventicle
of the Arians: they preferred death to submiffion; the flames that
were kindled by their despair, soon spread to the neighbouring
houses‚ and the triumph of Nestorius was clouded by the name of
incendimy. On either· fide of the Hellespont, his episcopal vigour
imposed a rigid formulary of faith and discipline; a chronological
error concerning the festival of Easter was punished as an offence
against the church and state. Lydia and Caria, Sardes and Miletus,
were purified with the blood of the obstinate Qartodecimans3 and

the edict of the emperor, or rather of the patriarch, enumerates three
and twenty degrees and denominations in the guilt and punishment
of heresy ³¹. But the sword of persecution, which Nestorius so
surioussy wielded, was soon turned against his own breast. Religion
was the pretence; but, in the judgment of a contemporary saint,
ambition was the genuine motive of episcopal warfare³²,

In the Syrian school, Nestorius had been taught to abhor the Hisheresy,

confusion ofthe two natm-es, and nicely to discriminate the humanity με’-ᾗ 1„

C H A Ρ· of his master Christ from the divinity of the Lord Jesus³³.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

The

μαψ-..ι Bless'ed Virgin he revered as the mother of Christ, but his ears were

offended with the ralh and recent title of mother of God ³³, which
had been insenfibly adopted since the origin of the Arian controversy.
From the pulpit of Constantinople‚ a friend of the patriarch, and
afterwards the patriarch himself, repeatedly preached against the use,
or the abiise, of a word ³⁵ unknown to the apostles, unauthorised by
the church, and which could only tend to alarm the timorous, to
mislead the simple, to amuse the profane, and to justify, by a seem-
ing resemblance, the old genealogy of Olympus ³⁶. In his calmer
moments Nestorius confcffed, that it might be tolerated or excused
by the union of the two natures‚ and the communication of their
idioms ³⁷: but he was exasperated‚ by contradistion, to disclaim the
worship of a new-born, an infant Deity, to draw his inadequafe

³³ La Croze (Christianisme des Indes,
tom. i. p. 44—53. Thesaurus Epistolicus
La Crozianus, tom. iii. p. 276—280.) has
detened the use of ὁ &mmm-5, and ὁ nvp-20<
Ιησες, which, in the ivm, vu, and vith cen-
turies, discriminates the school of Diodorus
of Tarsus and his Nestorian disciples.

³⁴ &zoroxog-Deipara : as in zoology we fa-
miliarly speak of oviparous and viviparous
animals. It is not easy to fix the invention
of this word, which La Croze (Christianisme
des Indes, tom. i. p. 16.) ascribes to Eusebius
of Caesarea and the Arians. The orthodox
testimonies are produced by Cyril and Peta-
vius (Dogmat. Theolog. tom. v. 1. v. c. ¹3·
p. 254, &c.); but the veracity of the saint
is questionable‚ and the epithet of &mom so
easily ssides from the margin to the text os a
Catholic MS.

³⁵ Basnage, in his Histoire de l'Eglise, a
work of controversy (tom. i. p. 505.), justi-
fies the mother, by the blood, of God (Acis,
xx. 28. with Mill’s various readings). But
the Greek MSS. are sar from unanimous;

and the primitive style of the blood of Christ
is preserved in the Syriae version, even in
those copies which were used by the Christi-
ans of St. Thomas on the coast of Malabar
(La Croze, Christianisme des Indes, tom. i,
p. 347.). The jealousy of the Nestorians
and Monophysnes has guarded the purity of
their text.

³⁶ The Pagans of Egypt already laughed
at the new Cybele of the Chrillians (Ifidor.
l. i. epist. 54.): a letter was forged in the
name of Hypatia‚ to ridicule the theology of
her ass'affin (Synodicon, c. 216. in iv torn.
Concil. p. 484). In the article of stro-
nius, Bayle has scattered some loose philo-
sophy on the worship of the Virgin Mary.

³⁷ The αντιδοσις of the Greeks, a mutual
loan or transfer of the idioms or properxies
of each nature to the other—of infinity to
man, paffibility to God‚ «Sec. Twelve rules
on this nicest of subjefts compose the Theo-
logical Grammar of petavius (Dogmata

Theolog. tom. v. 1. iv. c. 14, ¹5· p. 209,
δια).

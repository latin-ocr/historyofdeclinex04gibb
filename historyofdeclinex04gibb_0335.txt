OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE

The mode of its propagation is explained by the remark of Pro· C H A 1‘.

copius himself, that it always spread from the sea-coast to the in-
land country: the most sequestered issands and mount-ains wer<-
{uccessively visited3 the places which had escaped the fui-y 01³1ss
first passage, were alone exposed to the contagion of the ensuing
year. The winds might diffuse that subtle venom3 but unlelk
the atmosphere be previoussy disposed for its reception,‘the plagne
would soon expire in the cold or temperate elimates of the earth.
Such wasvthe universal corruption of the air, that the pestilence
which burst forth in the fifteenth year of Justinian was not
checked or alleviated by any difference of the seasons. In time, its
first malignity was abated and dispersed3 the disease alternately
languished and revived 3 but it was not till the end of a calamitous
period of fifty-two years, that mankind recovered their health, or
the air resnmed its pure and salubrious quality. No faite have
been preserved to sustain an account, or- even a conjefrure, of the
⁴numbers that perilhed in this extraordinary mortality. I only find,
that during three months, five, and at length ten, thousand persons
died each day at Constantinople ; that many cities of the East were
left vacant, and thatin several distriCls of Italy the harvest and the
’vintage withered on the ground. The triple scourge of war, pes-
tilence‚ and famine, afflieted the subjeCls of Justinian, and his reign
is disgraeed by a vifible deerease of the human species, which huz
never been repaired in some of the fairest countries of the globe ⁹⁵.

'OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Christian church of Jerusalem. A long train of the noblest Van· C H A P.

dals reluctantly exposed their lofty stature and manly countenance.
Gelimer ssowly advanced: he was clad in a purple robe, and still
maintained the majesty of a king. Not a tear escaped from his eyes,
not a figh was heard3 but his pride or piety derived some secret
consolation from the words of Solomon³³, which he repeatedly pro..
nounced, vAN1TY! VAN1TY! ALL IS VANITY ! Instead of ascend—
ing a triumphal car drawn by four horses or elephants, the
modest conqueror marched on foot at the head of his brave com-
panions: his prudence might decline an honour too conspicu-⁵
ous for a subjest; and his magnanimity might justly disdain what
had been so often sullied by the vilest of tyrants. The glori-
ous proceffion entered the gate of the hippodrome3 was saluted by

the acclamations of the senate and people3 and halted before the
throne where Justinian and Theodora were seated to receive the

homage of the captive monarch and the vic‘torious hero. They
both performed the customary adoration3 and falling prostrate on
the ground, respectfully touched the footstool of a prince who had
not unsheathed his sword, and of a prostitute, who had danced on
the theatre: some gentle violence was used to bend the stubborn
spirit of the grandson of Genseric ; and however trained to servitude,
the genius of Belisarius must have secretly rebelled. He was imme—
diately declared consul for the ensuing year, and the day of his in-
auguration resembled the pomp of a second triumph: his curule
chair was borne aloft on the ssmulders of captive Vandals ; and the

spoils of war, gold cups, and rich girdleS, were profusely scattered
among the populace.

³³ If the Ecclefiastes be truly a work of So· learned and free-spirited Grotius (Opp. Theo.
lomon‚ and not, like Prior's poem, a pious log. tom. i. p. 258.) : and indeed the Eccle-
and moral composition of more recent times, fiastes and Proverbs display a larger compafs
in his name, and on the subje& of his re· of thought and experiente than seem to be-v

pentance. The latter is the opinion of the long either to a Jew or a king.

oF THE ROMAN EMHRE. 619

The fate of Zadenghel was revenged by the courage and fortune of C XIIVII P.
Susneus, who ascended the throne under the name of Segued‚ and W
more vigoroussy prosecuted the pions enterprise of his kinsman.
After-the amusement of some unequal combats between the Jesuits
and his illiterate priests, the emperor declared himself a proselyte to
the synod of Chalcedon, presuming that his clergy and people would
embrace without delay the religion of their prince. The liberty of
choice was succeeded by a law, which imposed, under pain of death,

the belief of the two natures of Christ: the Abyffinians were en-

joined to work and to play on the Sabbath3 and Segued, in the face
of Europe and Africa, renounced his connection with the Alex-
andrian church. A Jesuit, Alphonso Mendez‚ the Catholic patriarch Converfion

of the em-

of AEthiopia‚ accepted in the name of Urban VIII. the homage petor,
and abjuration of his penitent. “ I confess‚'’ said the emperor on A. D' '6²⁶'
his knees, “ I confess that the pope is the vicar of Christ, the

‘⁶ succeffor of St. Peter, and the sovereign of the world. To him

“ I svvear true obedience, and at his feet Ι offer my person and

“ kingdom.'’ A similar oath was repeated by his son, his brother,

the clergy, the nobles, and even the ladies of the court: the Latin
patriarch was invested with honours and wealth3 and his miffionaries
ere&ed their churches or citadels in the most convenient stations of

the empire. The Jesnits 'themselves deplore the fatal indiscretion of
their chief, who forgot the mildness of the gospel and the policy

of his order, to introduce with hasty violence the liturgy of Rome

and the inquisition of Portugal. He condemned the ancient prac-

tice οἱ circumeifion, which health rather than superstition had first

invented in the climate of AEthiopia ¹⁶⁹. A new baptism, a new ordi-

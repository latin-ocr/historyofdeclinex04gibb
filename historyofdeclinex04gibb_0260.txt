THE DECLINE AND FALL

and the adjacent kingdoms, from the time of Mark Antony to that
of Nero3 and after the race of Polemo ⁷⁹ was extima, the eastern
Pontus, which preserved his name, extended no farther than the
neighbourhood of Trebizond. Beyond these limits the fortifications
of Hyffus‚ of Apsarus, of the Phafis, of Dioscurias or Sebastopolis,
and of Pityus, were guarded by sufficient detachments of horse and
foot3 and six princes of Colchos received their diadems from the
lieutenants of Caesar. One of these lieutenants, the eloquent and
philosophie Arrian, surveyed, and has described, the Euxine coast,
under the reign of Hadrian. The garrison which he reviewed at
the mouth of the Phafis‚ consisted of four hundred chosen legiona-
ries; the brick walls and towers‚ the double ditch, and the military
engines on the rampart, rendered this place inaccessible to the Bar-
barians ; but the new suburbs which had been built by the merchants
and veterans, required, in the opinion of Arrian, some external

defence ⁸⁰. As the strength of the empire was gradually impaired,

the Romans stationed on the Phafis were either withdrawn or ex· “

pelled; and the tribe of the Lazi ⁸¹, whose posterity speak a foreign
diale&, and inhabit the sea-coast of Trebizond, imposed their name
and dominion on the ancient kingdom of Colchos. Their independ-
ence was soon invaded by a formidable neighbour, who had ac· ,

quired, by arms and treaties, the sovcreignty of Iberia. The de-

northern ikirts of Colchos (Cellarius, Geo-

of justinian, they spread, or at least reigned,
over the whole country. At present, they

military deserti-021⁸. The posterity of the first conquerors struck a Q
deeper root into the soil, which, by every motive of interest and
honour, they were bound to defend. A Lombard was born the
soldier of his king and his duke3 and the civil affemblies of the
nation displayed the banners, and affirmed the appellation, of a regu-
lar army. Of this army, the pay and the rewards were drawn from
the conquered provinces3 and the distribution, Which was not
effe&ed till after the death of Alboin, is disgraced by the foul marks
of injustice and rapine. Many of the most wealthy Italians vvere
ssain or banished3 the remainder were divided among the strangers,
and a tributary obligatior] was imposed (under the name of hospi-
tality), of paying to the Lombards a third part of the fruits of the
earth. Within less than seventy years, this artificial system was
abolished by a more fimple and solid tenure ⁴². Either the Roman
landlord was expelled by his strong and insolent guest 3 or the annual
payment, a third of the produce, was exchanged by a more equi-
table transa&ion for an adequate proportion of lauded property.
Under these foreign masters, the busmess of agriculture, in the cul-
tivation of corn, vines, and olives, was exereised with degenerate
{kill and industry by the labour of the ssaves and natives. But the oe-
cupassons of a pastoral life vvere more pleasmg to the idleness of the
Barbarians. In the rich meadows of Venetia, they restored and irn-
proved the breed of horses for which that province had once been

s--v——t frequently reforms the jurisprudence of the Code and PandecTS. ’ In

the most rigorous Iuws, a wife was condemned to support a gamess
ster, a drunkard‚ or a libertine‚ unless he were guilty of homicide,
poison, or sacrilege, in which cases the marriage, as it should seem,
might have been diffolved, by the hand of the executioner. But
the sacred right of the husband was invariably maintained, to deliver
his name and family from the disgrace of adultery : the list of mortal
sms, either male or female, was curtailed and enlarged by successive
regulations, and· the obstacles of ineu-rable impotence‚ long absence,
and monastic profeffion, were allowed to rescind the matrimonia]
obligation. XVhoever t1·ansgreffed the permiffion of the law, was
subject to various and heavy penalties. The woman was stript of
her wealth and ornaments, without excepting the bodkin of her
hair: if the man introduced a new bride into his bed, her fortune
might be lawfully seized by the vengeance of his exiled wife. For-
feiture was sometimes commuted to a fine3 the fine was sometimes
aggravated by transporta-tion to an issand, or imprisonment in a
monastery: the injured party was released from the bonds of mar-

riage ; but the offender, during life or a term of yearS‚ was disabled
from the repetition of nuptials. The successor of Justinian yielded

to the prayers of his unhappy subje&5, and restored the liberty of
divorce by mutual consent: the civilians were unanimous¹³⁰, the

theologians were divided¹³¹, and the ambiguous word, which contains

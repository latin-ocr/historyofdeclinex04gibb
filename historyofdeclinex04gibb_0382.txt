THE DECLINE AND FALL

tion in which the ssave was unable to renounce her tyrant, and the
tyrant was unwilling to relinquish his ssave. XVhen the Roman
mati-ons became the equal and voluntary companions of their lords,
a new jurisprudence was introduced, that marriage, like other part-
nethips, might be dissolved by the abdication of one of the all'ociates.

’ In three centuries of prosperity and corruption, this principle was

enlarged to frequent praefice and pernicious abuse. Paffion, interest,
or caprice, suggested daily motives for the dissolution of 1narriage;
a word, a sign, a message, a letter, the mandate ofa freedman, de-
clared the separati0n3 the most tender of human connec'tions was
degraded to a tranfient society of profit or pleasure. According to
the various conditions of life, both sexes alternately felt the disgrace
and injury: an inconstant sponse transferred her wealth toa new ⁴
family, abandoning a numerous, perhaps a spurious, progeny to the
paternal authority and care of her late husband3 a beautiful virgin
might be dismiffed to the world, old, indigent, and friendless3 but
the reluctance of the Romans, when they were prefsed to marriage
by Augustus, sufficiently marks, that the prevailing institutions were
least favourable to the males. A specious theory is consnted by

this free and perse& experiment, which demonstrates, that the liberty
of divorce does not contribute to happiness and virtue. The facility
of separation would destroy all mutual confidence, and inflame every
triffing dispute: the minute difference between an husband and a
strangcr, which might so easily be removed, might still more easily

’ be forgotten 3 and the matron‚ who in five years can submit to the

embraces of eight husbands, must cease to reverence the chastity of

her own person ¹²⁵.

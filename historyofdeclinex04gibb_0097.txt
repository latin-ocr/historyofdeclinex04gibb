and in the thirty-fixth year of his reign, Justinian celebrated the
second dedication of a temple, which remains, after twelve centus-ies,
a stately monument of his farne. The architectum of St. Sophia,
’ which is now conver-ted into the principal mosch, has been imitated
by the Turkish sultans, and that venerable pile continues to excite
the fond admiration of the Greeks, and the more rational curiosity

of European travellers. The eye of the spectator is disappointed Description-

by an irregular prospe& of half-domes and shelving roofs: the
western front, the principal approach, is destitute of simplicity and
magnificence3 and the scale of dimenfions has been much surpassed
by several of the Latin cathedrals. But the architec'c who first ere&-
ed an aerlal cupola, is entitled to the praise of bold defign and sszi'lful
execution. The dome of St. Sophia, illuminated by four and twenty
windows, is formed with so small a curve, that the depth is equal
only to one-fixth of its diameter-3 the measure of that diameter is
one hundred and fifteen feet, and the lofty center, where a crescent
has supplanted the cross, rises to the perpendicular height of one
hundred and eighty feet above the pavement. The circle which
encompaffee the dome, lightly reposes on four strong arches, and their
weight is firmly support-ed by four maffy piles, whose strength is
affisted on the northern and southern fides by four columns of Egyp-
tian gmnite. A Greek erese, inscribed in a quadrangle, represents the
form of the edifice 3 the exa& breadth is two hundred and forty-three
feet, and two hundred and sixty=nine may be affigned for the ex·-
treme length from the sane’tuary in the east to the nine western
doors which open into the vestibffle, and from thence into the mn·-
thex or exterior portico· That portico was the humble station of
the penitents. The nave or body of the church was filled by the

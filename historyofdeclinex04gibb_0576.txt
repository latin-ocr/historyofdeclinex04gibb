C >liwir P. tyches was filled by a thousand shades of language and opiui0n3 the
ι...-ν-...’.ι acephali ⁷³ of Egypt, and the Roman pontiss's, os equal valour, though

of uncqual strength, may be found at the two extremities of the theo-

logical scale. The acephali, without a king or a bissiop, were sepa-
rated above three hundred years from the patriarchs of Alexandria,
who had accepted the communion of Constantinople‚ without
exafilin'g a formal condemnation of the synod of Chalcedon. For
accepting the communion of Alexandria, without a formal appro-
bation of the same synod, the patriarchs of Constantinople were
anathematised by the popes. Their inflexible despotism involved the
most orthodox of the Greek churches in this spiritual contagi0n‚
deuied or doubted the validity of their sac1·aments⁷⁴‚ and fomented,
thirty—five years, the schism of the East and West, till they finally
aboliffled the memory of four Byzaritine pontiffs‚ -who had dared to

oppose the supremacy of St. Peter⁷⁵. Before that period, the pre-
carious truce of Constantinople and Egypt had been violated by the
zeal of the rival prelates. Macedonhrs, who was suspetfted of the
Nestorian heresy, asserted, in disgrace and exile, the synod of Chal-
cedon, while the successor of Cyril would have purchased its

overthrow with a bribe of two thousand pounds of gold.

the sacraments, which had failed for want of
an episcopal ordination.

gruam pracbemus fine difficultate medicinam
(Gelasrus, in epist. i. ad Euphemiam, Con-
cilstom. v. p. 286.). The offer osa medicine
proves the disease, and numbers must have
faerissicd before the arrival of the Roman phy-

proud uncharitable temper ofthe popes: they
are now glad, says he, to inreke St. Flavian
of Antioch, St. Elias of Jerusalem, ἃς. to
whom they refused communion whilst upon
earth. But cardinal Baronius is firm and
hardas the rock of St. Peter.

tych of the chureh: ex venerabili· diptycho,

(Concil. tom. iv. p. 1346). This ecclelia(-

book of lise.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {LA} P. sunk deep into the mind of Theodora, was felt long afterwards {nl

beauty, the three fisters were successively devoted to the public and
private pleasures of the Byzantine pcople; and Theodora, after
following Comito on the stage, in the dress of a ssave, with a stool

were abandoned to a promiscuous crowd of citizens and strangers,
of every rank, and of every profeffion : the fortunate lover who had
been promised a night of enjoyment, was often driven from her bed
by a stronger or more ‘wealthy favourite3 and when {he paffed
through the streets‚ her presence was avoided by all who wished to

THE DECLINE AND FALL

were diffipated by a storin. In the second they approached the ἦ ²

shore3 but they saw the hills covered with archers, the landing-

place defended by a line of spears, and the king of the Goths ir‘n- ¹
patient for battle. The conqueror of Italy retired with a figh, and ’··
continued to languisti, inglorious and inadfive, till Antonina, who ἶ =
had been sent to Constantinople to solicit succours, obtained, after Ἰ

the death of the empress, the permiffion of his return.

⁴ The five last campaigns of Belisarius might abate the envy of his
competitore, whose eyes had been dazzled and wounded by the blaze ’. ὀ
of his former glory. Instead of delivering Italy from the Goths, he ’ *f
had wandered like a fugitive along the coast, without daring to f 3
march into the country, or to accept the bold and repeated challenge '· ἶ
of Totila. Yet in the judgment of the few who could discriminate s ,’
eounsels from events, and compare the instruments with the execution, ’ “
he appeared a more consummate master of the art of war, than in · ³

before the throne of §Iustiniani The valour of Belisarius was not

chilled- by age3 his prudence was matured by experience, but the Γ1 Y?
moral virtues of humanity and justice seem to have yielded to the ζ ,ι
hard neceffity of the fimes. The parfimony or poverty of the em- ·’ '⁸'
peror compelled him to deviate from the rule of conduct which ³
had deserved the love and confidence of the Italians. The war was 'J- ' ³
maintained by the oppreffion of Ravenna, Sicily, and all the faithful: Δ , ’ἱ
subje&s of the empire3 and the rigorous prosecution of Herodian. - · ⁴
provoked that injured or guilty officer to deliver Spoleto into the ῥ’ ’,
hands of the enemy. The avari-ce of Antonina‚ which had been some· , 3

times· diverted by love, now reigned without a rival in her breast.

Belisarius himself had always understood, that siches, in a corrupt ““ ,⁴

age, are the support and ornament of personal merit. And it* can-
not be presumed that he should stain his honour for the· public

service, without applying a part of the spoil to his private emolu-
7 ment..

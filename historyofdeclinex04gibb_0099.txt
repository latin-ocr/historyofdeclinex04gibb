or THE ROMAN EMPIRE„ 95

··0f St. Sophia, enumerates the colour3‚ the fluidos, and the spots of C {LA P*
ten or twelve marbles, jaspers, and porphyries‚ which nature had pro- ι--υ-σ--θ
fusely diverfified‚ and which were blendcd and oontrasted as it were

by a skilful painter. The triumph of Christ was adorned with the

last spoils of Paganism, but the greater part of these costly stones was
extracsted from the quarries of Asta Minor, the isses and continent

of Greece, Egypt, Africa, and Gaul. Eight columns of porphyry,
which Aurelian had placed in the temple of the sun, were offered

by the piety of a Roman matron; eight others of green marble

were presented by the ambitious zeal of the magistrates of Ephesus z

both are admirable by their ΗΖΕ and beauty, but every order of
architeClure disclaims their fantastic capitals, A variety of orna-
ments and figures was curioussy expreffed in mosaic3 and the ima-ges

of Christ, of the Virgin‚ of saints, and of angels, which have been
defaced by Turkish fanaficffm, were dangerously exposed to the
superstition of the Greeks. According to the sanctity of each objec‘r,

the precious metals were distributed in thin leaves or in solid maffes,

The balustrade of the choir‚ the capitale of the pillars, the ornaments

of the dom-s and galleries, were of *gilt bronze3 the spectator was
dazzled by the glittering aspe& of the cupola3 the sandiuary con-
tained forty thousand pound weight of silver3 and the holy vases

and vestments of the altar were of the purest gold, enriched with in-
estimable gems. Before the strudfflre of the churoh had arisen two

vwere already consumed3 and the whole expence amounted to three Ρ-ἷςῗὲἓῑ·

the sincerity of the royal consortS, that their seeming disagl‘ee-
ment was imparted by many to a secret and mischievous confederacy
against the religion and happiness of their people⁹³. The famous

' dispute of the ΤΗΚ-ΕΒ CHAPTERS ⁹⁴, which has filled more volumes

than it deserves lines, is deeply marked vvith this subtle and dism-
genuous spirit. It was now three hundred years since the body of
Origen ⁹⁵ had been eaten hythe worms :¹ his soul, of which he held
the pre—existence, was in the hands of its Creator, but his writings
were eagerly perused by the monks of Palestine. In these vvritings⁹
the piet-cing eye of Justinian descried more than ten metaphysical
errors; and the primitive doctor, in the company of Pythagoras and
Plato, usae devoted hythe clergy to the eternity of hell-fise, which
he had presumed to deny. Under the cover of this precedent, a,
treacherous blow was aimed at the council of Chalcedon. Thev
fathers had listened without impatience to the praise of Theodore of
Mopsuestia ⁹⁶: and their justice or indulgence had restored both

the secret historian, their common suspicion
proves at least the general hatred.

the original afts of the t‘h general council of
Constantinople supply much useless, though
authentic, knowledge (Concil. tom. vi. p. 1

de tribus capitulis, which are most correffly
publiffied by Sirmond), Liberatus (in his Bre-
viarium, c. 22, 23, ²4·)’ and Victor Tunu-
nensis in his Chronicle (in tom. i. Antiq.
Lect. Cauifii, p. 330—334.). TheLiber Pon-
tilicalis, or Anastasius <in Vigstio, Pelagio,

modern reader will derive some information
from Dupin (Bibliot. Eccles. tom. v, p. 189

resolved to depreciate the authority and cha·

to imitate the πλαψ and ,ἕίνσσεβεια ofthe old phi-⁷

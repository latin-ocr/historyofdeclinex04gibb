OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

pendent king of Lazica, received his sceptre at the hands of the Per-
fian monarch, and the succeffors of Constantine acquieseed in this
injurious claim, which was proudly urged as a right of immemorial
prescription. In the beginning of the fixth century, their influenee
was restored by the introdu&ion of Christianity‚ which the Mingre..
lians still profess with becoming zeal‚ without understanding the
doctrines, or observing the precepts of their religion. After the
decease of his father, Zathus was exalted to the regal dignity by
the favour of the great king: but the pious youth abhorred the
ceremonies of the Magi, and fought, in the palacc of Cons‘czmfinople,

and his cloak and tunic of white filk, with a gold border, dis-
played, in rich embroidery, the figure of his new patron3 who
soothed the jealousy of the Perfian court, and excused the revolt of
Colchos, by the venerable names of hospitality and religion. The
common interest of both empires imposed on the Colchians the duty

of Mingrelia⁸².

the Lazi were inceffantly reminded‚ by words and affifions, of their
dependent state. At the distance of a day's journey beyond the
Apsarus, they beheld the rising fortress of Petra ⁸³, which com-

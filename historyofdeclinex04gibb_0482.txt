480 'THE DECLINE AND FALL

*C {impl P. peace and alliance of the two empires were faithfull'y maintained.
sev-⁴ Yet the mercenary friendssiip of the Roman prince had been pur-

chased with costly and important gifts: the strong cities of Mar-

tyropolis and Dara were restored, and the Persarmenians became

the willing subje6³oe of an empire, whose eastern limit was extended,

beyond the example of former times, as far as the banks of the

Araxes and the neighbourhood of the Caspian. A pious hope was
indulged, that the church as well as the state might triumph in this
revolution: but if Ch'osroes had sincerely listened to the Christian
bissiops, the impression was erazed by the zeal and eloquence of the
Magi : if he was armed with philosophie indifference‚ he accommo-
dated his belief, or rather his profeffions, to the various circumstances
of an exile and a sovereigu. The imaginary conversion of the king
of Persia was reduced to a local and superstitious veneration for Ser-
gius¹⁹, one of the saints of Antioch, who heard his prayers and ap-
peared to him in dreams3 he enriched the shrine with offerings of
gold and filver, and ascribed to this invislble patron the success of
his arms, and the pregnancy of Sira, a devout Christian and the
best beloved of his wives ²⁰. The beauty of Sira, οι· Sehi1·in²¹‚ her
wit, her musical talents, are still famous in the history or rather in
the romances of the East : her own name is expressive, in the Persian

tongue, of sweetness and grace3 and the epithet of Parviz alludes

¹⁹ Sergius and his companion Bacchus,
who are said to have suffered in the persecu-
tion of Maximian, obtained divine honour in
France, Italy, Constantinople, and the East.
Their tomb at Rasaphe was famous for rni-
racles, and that Syrian town acquired the

on crosses and tables of gold, which were de-
poficed in the church of Sergiopolis. They
had been sent to the bishop of Antioch‚ as ’
primate of Syria. “

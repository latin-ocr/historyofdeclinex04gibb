the ground-work perhaps of a marvellous fame, affords a faint image
of the wealth extraCted from a virgin earth by the power and in-
dustry of ancient kings. Their sllver palaces and golden chambers
surpass our belief3 but the fame of their riches is said to have
excit‘ed the enterprismg avarice of the Argonautsffl‘. Tradition has af-
firmed, with some colour of reason, that Egypt planted on the
Phasis, a learned and polite colony⁶⁹‚ which manufaerured lineri,
built navies, and invented geographical maps. The ingenuity of
the moderns has peopled, with flourishing cities and nadons, the
isthmus between the Euxine and the Caspian⁷⁰; and a lively writer,
observing the resemblance of climate, and, in his apprehenfion, of
trade, hasrnot hefitated to pronounce Colchos the Holland of an-
tiquity⁷'.

But the siches of Colchos {hine only through the darkness of
conje&ure or tradition; and its genuine history presents an uniform
scene of rudeness and poverty. If one hundred and thirty languages
were spoken in the market of Dioscurias ⁷², they were the imperfe&
idionis of so many savage tribes 01· families, sequestered from each
other in the vallies of mount Caucasus3 and their separation, which
‹liminished the importance, must have multiplied the number, of

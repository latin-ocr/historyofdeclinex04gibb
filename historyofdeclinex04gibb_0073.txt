OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 69

of Jufiinian, and the greens, with their upstart emperor, were left ber—³

but the military force of Justinian consisted in three thousand ve-
terane, vvho had been trained to valour and discipline in the Persian

and Illyrian wars. Under the command of Belisarius and Mundus,
they filently marched in two divifions from the palace, forced their
obscure way through narrovv passages, expiring flames, and falling
edifices, and burst open at the same moment the two opposite gates
of the hippodrome. In this narrow space, the disorderly and af-
frighted crowd was incapable of refisting on either fide a firm and
regular attack3 the blues signalized the fury of their repentauce3
and it is computed‚ that above thirty thousand persons were ssain in
the merciless and promiscuous carnage of the day. Hypatius was
dragged from his throne, and conducted with his brother Pompey
to the feet of the emperor: they implored his clemency3 but their
crime was manifest, their innocence uncertain, and justinian had
been too much terrified to forgive. The next morning the two
nephevvs of Anastasius, with eighteen iffistrious accomplices, of pa·-
trician or consular rank, were privately executed by the soldiers3
their bodies were thrown into the sea, their palaces razed, and their
fortunes confiscated. The hippodroxne itself was condemned, during
several years, to a mournful filence: with the restoration of the
games, the same disorders revived3 and the blue and green faetions
continued to affliet the reign of Justinian, and to disturb the tran-
xquillity of the Eastern empire⁵³.

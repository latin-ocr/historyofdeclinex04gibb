202 THE· DECLINE AND FALL

C {Lici P· “” the Gothic war was no longer worthy of his presence: a gracious

s--v--d ‘'‘ sovereign was impatient to reward his services, and to consult his

ghD'sso' “ wisdom' 3 and he alone was capable of defending the East against '
‘⁶ the innumerable armies of Perlia.’' Belisarius understood the
suspicion, accepted the excuse, embarked at Ravenna his spoils and
trophies; and proved, by his ready obedience, that such an abrupt
removal from the government of Italy was not less unjust than it
might have been indiscreet. The emperor received with honourable,

supplied, even· in a servile age, by the respe& and admiration of his
country. XVhenever hc appeared in the streets and public places of.
Constantinople, Belisarius attracted and satisfied the eyes of the.
people. His lofty stature and majestic countenance fulfilled their>
expedhadons of an he1·o; the meanest of his fellow-citizens were
emboldened by his gentle and gracious demeanour3 and the martial*

train which attended his footsteps, left his person more acceflible·

nature is indifferent, reason mute, and custom various and arbitrary.
In Egypt, the marriage of brothers and sisters was admitted without
scruple or exception: a Spartan might espouse the daughter of his
father, an Athenian, that of his mother; and the nuptials of an

brothers, hesitated whether first cousins should be touched by the
same interdict; revered the parental character of aunts and uncles‚
and treated affinity and adoption as a just imitation of the ties of
blood. According to the proud maxims of the republic‚ a legal
marriage could only be contracted by free citize1is; an honourable,

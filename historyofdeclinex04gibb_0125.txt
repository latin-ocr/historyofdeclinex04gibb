OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the minds of the people; they fondly expected its speedy r·est01a- C H LA l
t10n· ‚ they applauded the gracious condescenfion of lucceffive princes v--v—-a
by whom it was affumed 111 the first year of their reign, and three

centuries elapsed‚ after the death

of Justinian, before tliat obsolcte

dignity, which had been suppreffed by custom, could be abolilhed by

law¹ ⁵⁹. The imperfe& mode of

distinguishing each year by the

name of a magistrate, was usefully supplied by the date of a per-
manent aera: the creation of the world, according to the septuagint

verslon, was adopted by the Greeks¹⁶⁰
of Charlemagne, have computed their time from the birth of

Christ ¹⁶¹.

¹⁵⁹ By Leo, the philosopher (Novell. xciv.
A. D. 886—911.). See Pagi (Differtat. Hy-
patica, p. 325—362.) and Ducange (Gloff.
Graec. p. 1635, 1636.). Even the title was
vilified: consulatus codicilli. . . . vilescunt,
says the emperor himself.

'¹⁶⁰ According to Julius Africanus, διε. the
world was created the first of September,

5508 years, three months, and twenty—five
days before the birth of Christ (see Pezron,

Antiquite des Tems defendiie, p. 20-28.);
and this aera has been used by the Greeks, the
Oriental Christians‚ and even by the Ruffians,
till the reign of Peter 1. The period, how-
ever arbitrary, is clear and convenient. Of
the 7296 years which are supposed to elapse
fince the creation, we shall find 3000 os ig-
norance and darkness3 2000 either fabulous
or doubtfu1; 1000 of ancient history, com-
mencing with the Perfian empire, and the re-

and the Latius, since the age

publics of Rome and Athens; 1000 from the
fall of the Roman empire in the west to the
discovery of America; a‘nd the remaining
296 will almost complete three centuries of
the modern state of Europe and mankind. Ι
regret this chronology, so far preferable to our
double and perplexed method of counting·
backwards and forwards the years before and
after the Christian aera.

¹⁶¹ The aera of the world has prevailed
in the East since the vith general council
(A. D. 681). In the West the Christian aera
was first invented in the vith century: it was
propagated in the viiith hy the authority and
writings of venerable Bede3 but it was not
till the λύ’ that the use became legal and po-
pular. See l'Art de verifier les Dates, Dis-

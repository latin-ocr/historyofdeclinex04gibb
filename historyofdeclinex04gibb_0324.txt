If the emperor could rejoice in the death of Belisarius, he enjoyed
the base satisfaction only eight months, the last period of a reign of
thirty-eight, and a life of eighty-three years. It would be difficult
to trace the chara&er of a prince who is not the most conspicuous
object of his own times: but the confessions of an enemy may bc
received as the safest evidence of his virtues. The resemblance of
justinian to the bust of Domitian, is malicioufly urged⁷¹3 with the
acknowledgrnent, however, of anwell-proportioned figure, a rudtly
complexion, and a pleasmg countenance. The emperor was easy
of access, patient of hearing, courteous and affable in discourse, and
a master of the angry paffions, which rage with such destruc‘tive
violence in the breast of a despot. Procopius praises his temper to
*reproach him with calm and deliberate cruelty5 but in the conspi-
racies which attacked his authority and person, a more candid jud'ge
will approve the justice, or admire the clemency of Justinian. He
excelled in the private virtues of chastity and temperance: but the
impartial love of beauty would have been less mischievous, than his

Heraclius boldly ascended the heights of mount Taurus, directed
his march through the plains of Cappadocia, and established his
troops for the winter season in safe and plentiful quarters on the
banks of the river Halys⁸². His soul was superior to the vanity of
entertaining Constantinople with an imper-fe& triumph: but the
presence of the emperor was indispensably required to soothe the rest-

for a while the provinces, and to insult with impunity the capital of
the East3 while the Roman emperor explored his perilous wa&

trated into the heart of Perfia²³⁵‚ and recalled the armies of the great
king to the defence of their bleeding country. With a select band

of five thousand soldiers‚ Heraclius sailed from Constantinople to

praise is far from corresponding with the san-
guine hopes os Pagi, D’Anville, Sec.

swiftly (κατα ταχυ ) into Armenia. Nicepho-
rus (p. 11.), though hx confounds the two
expeditionis, defines the province of Lazica.
Eutychius (Annal. tom.ii. p. 231.) has given

of Trebizond.

a fair wind, four or five days; from thence

to Erzerom, five ; to Erivan, twelve; to Tau-
ris, ten3 in all, thirty-two. Such is the Iti-
nerary of Tavernier (Voyages, torn. i. p. 12
—56.)‚ who was perfeftly conversant with
the reads off Afia. Teumeson, who travel-
led with a pass-ra, spent ten or twelve days
between Trebizond and Erzerom (Voyage
du Levant, tom. iii. lettre xviii.) ; and Char-
din (Voyages, tom. i. p. 249·254-) gives the
more corre& distance of fifty-three pamfangs,

each of 5000 paces (what paces ?), between
Erivan and Tauris.

p. 539—573.). He discovers the situation of
Gandzaca, Thebarma, Dastagerd, &c. with
admirable skill and learning3 but the obscure
campaign of 624, he paffes over in silence.

μην-ω nople, and were soon enrolled, for their strength and stature, among
the guards of the emperor Leo. Under the two succeeding reigns,
the fortunate peasant emerged to wealth and honours; and his
escape from some dangers which threatened his life, was afterwards
ascribed to the guardian angel who watches over 'the fate of kings.
His long and laudable service in the Isaurian and Perfian wars, would

rael: or the stake, would tremble and fly before the face of an armed
enemy. The ‘pusillanimous temper of the Egyptians could only
hope for a change of masters ς the arms of Chosroes depopulated the
land, yet under his reign the Jacobites enjoyed a [hort and preca-
rions respite. The vic'tory οἱ Heraclius renewed and aggravated
*the persecution, and the patriarch again escaped from Alexandria to
the desert. In his ssight, Benjamin was encouraged by a voice,
which bad him expect, at the end of ten years, the aid of a foreign
nation, marked like the Egyptians themselves with the ancient rite
of circumcision. The character of these deliverers, and the nature
of the deliverance‚ will be hereafter explained5 and I shall step over
the interval of eleven centuries to observe the present misery of the
Jacobites of Egypt. The populous city of Cairo affords a refidence
or rather a shelter for their indigent patriarch, and a remnant of ten
bilhops: forty monaster-ies have survived the inroads of the Arabs5
and the progr-ess of servitude and apostasy have reduced the Coptic
nation to the despicable number of twenty-five or thirty thousand
families¹⁴⁸3 a racc of illiterate beggars, whose only consolation is
derived from the superior wretchedness of the Greek patriarch and
his diminutive congregation ¹⁴⁹.

¹⁴³ This number is taken from the curious
Recherches sur les Egyptiens et les Chinois
(tom. ii. p. 192, 193.), and appears more
probable than the 6oo,000 ancient, or ¹5·000
modern, Copts of Gemelli Carreri. Cyril
Lucar, the protestant patriarch of Constanti-
nople‚ laments that those heretics were ten
times more numerous than his orthodox

Greeks, ingenioussy applying the πολλαι κεν

ἒηεκὲες Betria-ro oumxom Of Homer (Illad 11.

¹⁴⁹ The history of the Copts‚ their religion,
manners, διε. may be found in the Abbt': Re-

naudot’s motley work, neither a transsation
nor an origin-ah the Chronicon Orientale
of Peter, a Jacobite; in the two verfions
of Abraham Ecchellenfis‚ Paris, 1651;
and John Simon Affeman, Venet. 1729.
These annals descend no lower than the xiiith
century. The more recent accounts must be
searched for in the travellers into Egypt, and
the Nouveaux Memoires des Miffions de Le-
vant. In the last century, Joseph Abudacnus,
a native of Cairo, published at Oxford, in
thirty pagos, a ssight Historia Jacobitarum,

The system of Apollinaris was strenuoussy encountered by the Afiatic

and Syrian divines, whose schools are honoured by the names of Ι

Bam, Gregory, and Chrysostorn, and tainted by those of Diodorus,
Theodore, and Nestorius. But the person of the aged bishop of
Laodicea, his character and dignity, remained inviolate3 and his

rating, the divinity‚ and the humanity of Christ. Impelled by re-
ligious frenzy, they fied with adverse haste from the error which
they mutually deemed most destructive of truth and salvation. On
either hand they were anxious to guard, they were jealous to de-

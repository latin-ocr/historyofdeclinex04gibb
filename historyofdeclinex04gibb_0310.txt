W bats, and Teias maintained this important post, till he was deserted

by his fleet and the hope of subsistence. With reluftant steps he
ascended the Lafflzricm mount, where the physicians of Rome, since
the time of Galen, had sent their patients for the benefit of the air
and the mill-1⁴³. But the Goths soon embraced a more generous
resolution: to descend the hill, to dismiss their horses, and to die
in arms, and in the poffeffion of freedom. The king matched at
their head, bearing in his right—hand a lance, and an ample buc‘kler
in his left: With the one he struck dead the foremost of the affailant55
with the other, he received the weaponsv which every hand was
ambitious to aim against his life. After a combat of many hours,
his left arm was fatigued by the weight of twelve javelins which
hung from his shield. without moving from his ground, or sus-
pending his blows, the hero called aloud on his attendants for a
frelh buckler, but in the moment, while his fide was uncovered, it
was pierced by a mortal dart. He fell: and his head, exalted on a
spear, proclaimed to the nations, that the Gothic kingdom was nov κ’
more. But the example of his death served only to animate the
companions who had sworn to perilh with their leader. They
fought till darkness descended on the earth. They reposed on their
arms. The combat was renewed with the return of light, and
maintained with unabated vigour till the evening of the second day.
The repose of a second night, the want of water, and the loss of
their bravest champions, determined the surviving Goth: to accept
the fair capitulation which the prudence of Nax-ses was inclined to
propose. They embraced the alternative of residing in Italy as the
subjefi‘ts and [oldiers of Justinian, or departing with a portion of

of mount Ladhrius, whose medicinal bene· left except the name of the town of Latere.

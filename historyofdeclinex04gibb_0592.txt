original aCts were committed to the flames. But in the second year,
their patron was cast headlong from the throne, the bishops of the
East were released from their occafional conformity, the Roman
faith was more firmly replanted by the orthodox successore of Bar-
danes, and the fine problema of the incarnation were forgotten in

the more popular and vifible quarrel of the worship of images¹⁰⁷.

Before the end of the seventh century, the creed of the incarna-
tion, which had been defined at Rome and Constantinople, was
uniformly preached in the remote issands of Britain and Ireland ¹⁰⁸:
the same ideas were entertained, or rather the same words were
repeated, by all the Christians whose liturgy was performed in the
Greek or the Latin tongue. Their numbers, and visible splendour,
bestowed an imperfect claim to the appellation of Catholics: but in
the East, they were marked with the less honourable name of
Melchites, or Royalists¹⁹⁹3 of men, whose saith, instead of resting

¹⁰⁷ The history of Monothelitism may be
found in the Afts of the Synods of Rome
(tom. vii. p. 77-395. 601-608.) and Con-
stantinople (p. 609—1429.). Baronius ex-
traCted some original documents from the
Vatican library; and his chronology is rec-
tified by the diligence of Pagi. Even Du-
pin (Bibliotheque Eccles. tom. vi. p. 57-
71.) and Basnage (Hist. de l'Eglise, tom. i.
p. 541—555.) afford a tolerable abridgment.

¹0³ In the Lateran synod of 679, Wilfrid,
an Anglo-Saxon hishop, subscribed pro omni
Aquilonati parte Britanniae et Hiberniae, quae
ab Anglorum et Brinonum, necnon Scoto-
rum et Pietorum gentibus colebantur (Ed-
dius, in Vit. St. Wilfrid. c. 31. apud Pagi,
Cridca, tom. iii. p. 88.). Theodore (mag-
nae insulae Britanniae archiepiscopus et philo-
sophus) was long expected at Rome (Concil.
tom. vii. p. 714.); but he contented himself
with holding (A. D. 680) his provincial sy-
nod of Hatfield, in which he received the

decrees of pope Martin and the first Lateran
council against the Monothelites (Concil-
tom. vii. p. 597, δια). Theodore, a monk
of Tarsus in Cilicia, had been named to the
primacy of Britain by pope Vitalian (A. D.
668. See Baronius and Pagi), whose esteem
for his learning and piety was tainted by some
distrust ofhis national charafier-ne quid cou-
trarium veritati fidei, Graecorum more in ec-
clesiam cui prreesset introduceret. The Cili-
cian was sent from Rome ιο Canterbury under
the tuition of an African guide (Bedae Hist.
Eccles. Anglorum, l. iv. c. 1.). He adhered
to the Roman doftrine3 and the same creed
of the incarnation has been uniformly trans-
mitted from Theodore to the modern pri-
mates, whose found understanding is perhaps
seldom engaged with that abstruse mystery.

the west and the Euxine3 bending to the south-west, the river paffes
under the walls of Satala and Melitene (which were restored by
Justinian as the bulwarks of the lesser Armenia), and gradually ap-
proaches the Mediterranean sea; till at length, repelled by Mount
Taurus ¹³¹, the Euphrates inclines his long and flexible course to the
south-east and the gulf of Persia. Among the Roman cities beyond
the Euphrates, we distinguissi two recent foundations, which were
named from Theodosius, and the relies of the martyrs; and two
capitals‚ Amida and Edessa, which are celebrated in the history of
every age. Their strength was proportioned by Justinian to the dan-
ger of their situation. A ditch and palisade might be sufficient to
resist the artless force of the cavalry of Scythia3 but more elaborate
works were required to sustain a regular siege against the arms and
treasures of the great king. His skilful engineers understood the
methods of condueting deep mines, and of raising platforms to the
level of the rampart: he shook the strongest battlements with his
military engines, and sometimes advanced to the affault with abline
of moveable turrets on the backs of elephants. In the great cities
of the East, the disadvantage of space, perhaps of position, was com-
pensated by the zeal of the people, who seconded the gai-rison in
the defence of their country and religion3 and the fabulous promise of
the Son of God, that Edessa should never be taken, filled the citizens
with valiant confidence, and chilled the besiegers with doubt and

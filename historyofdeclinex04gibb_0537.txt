OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

'the Hebrews might ascribe to a saint and martyr, the adoptive title
·of SoN oF Gon. ‚

Yet in the insufficient creed of the Nazarenes and the Ebionites,
a distinction is faintly noticed between the heretice, who eonfounded
the generation of Christ in the common order of nature, and the
less guilty schismatics, who revered the virginity of his mother, and
excluded the aid of an earthly father. The incredulity of the
former was countenanced by the vifible circumstances of his birth,
the legal marriage of his reputed parents, Joseph and Many, and his
lineal claim to the kingdom of David and the inheritance of Judah.
But the secret and authentie history has been recorded in several
‘copies of the gospel according to St. Matthew θ’, which these seam-ies
long preserved in the original Hebrew ⁵ as the sole evidence of their
faith. The natural suspicions of the husband, conscious of his own
chastity, were dispelled by the affurance (in a dream) that his wife
was pregnant of the Holy 'C-host: and as this distant and domestic
prodigy could not fall under the personal observation of the historiam,
he must have listened to the same voice which dictated to Isaiah the
future conception of a virgin. The son of a virgin, generated by
the ineffable operation of the Holy Spirit, was a creature without
example or resemblance, superior in every attribute of mind and body

to the children of Adam. Since the introduction of the Greek or

4 The two first chapters of St. Matthew did
not exist in the Ebionite copies (Epiphan.
Haeres. xxx. 13.); and the miraculous con-
ception is one of the last articles which Dr.
Priestly has curtailed from his scanty creed.

⁵ Itis probable enough that the first of the
gospels for the use of the Jewish converts, was
composed in the Hebrew or Syriae idiom: the
fa& is attested by a chain of fathers—Papias,
Irenaeus, Origen‚ Jerom, διε. It is devoutly
believed by the Cachofics, and admitted by
Casaubon, Grotius, and Isaac Vossius‚ among

the protestant critics. But this Hebrew go-
spcl of St. Matthexv is most unaccountably
lost3 and we may accuse the diligence or fl-
delity of the primitive churehes, who have
preferred the unauthorised version of some
nameless Greek. Erasmus and his followers,
who respect our Greek text as the original
gospel, deprive themselves of the evidence
which declares it to be the work of an apostle.

OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

ruin and the throne 3 and fear as well as ambition might exasperare
Theodora against two generals, who„ during a malady of the cm..
peror, had ralhly declared that they were not disposed to acquiesce
in the choice of the capital. But the reproach of cruelty, so re-
pugnant even to her softer vices, has left an indelible stain on the
:memory of Theodora. Her numerous spies observed, and zealoussy
reported, every aetion, or word, or look, injurious to their royal
mistress. Whomsoever they accused were cast into her peculiar
prisons³¹‚ inaccessible to the enquiries of justice; and it was ru-
moured, that the torture of the rack, or scourge, had been inflieced
in the presence of a female tyrant, insenfible to the voice of prayer
or of pity³². Some of these unhappy victims pefflhed in deep un-
wholesome dungeons, while others were permitted, after the loss of
their limbs, their reason, or their fortune, to appear in the world

extended to the children of those whom she had suspected οι· in-

had pronounced, was delivered to a trusty meffenger, and his dili-
gence was quickened by a menace from her own mouth„ “ If you

⁴‘ for ever, that your {kin shall be flayed from your body ³³.’'

If the creed of Theodora had not been tainted with heresy‚ her
exemplary devotion might have atoned, in the opinion of her con-
temporaries, for pride, avarice‚ and cruelty. But, if she employed
her influence to affuage the intolerant fury of the emperor, the pre-
tsent age will allow some merit to her religion, and much indulgence

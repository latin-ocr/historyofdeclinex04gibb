THE DECLINE AND FALL

⁷- If Belisarius had been tempted to hefitate in his allegiance, he

might have urged, even against the emperor himself, the indis- .

pensable duty of saving Africa from an enemy more barbarous than
the Vandals. The origin of the Moors is involved in darkness:
they were ignorant of the use of letters ⁴⁰. Their limits cannot be
precisely defined: a boundless continent was open to the Libyan.
shepherd33 the change of seasons and pastures regulated their mo·-⁴
tions; and their rude huts and ssender furniture were transported‘
with the same ease as their arms, their families‚ and their cattle,
which confisted of sheep, oxen, and camels⁴¹. During the vigour
of the Roman power, they observed a respeefful distance from Car-
thage and the sea-{hore 3 under the feeble reign of the Vandals, they
invaded the cities of Numidia, occupied the sea-coast from Tangier
to Caesarea, and pitched their camps, with impunity, in the fertile
province of Byzacium. The formidable strength and artful con-
du& of Belisarius secured the neutrality of the Moorish princes,
whose vanity aspired to receive, in the emperor’s name, the enfigns
of their regal dignity⁴². They were astonilhed by the rapid event,
and trembled in the presence of their conqueror. But his approach-

Under the reign of Dagobert (A. D. 630.),
the Sclavonian tribes of the Sorbi and Venedi
already bordered on Th uringia (Mascou, Hm.
ofthe Genuam, xv. 3. 4, 5.).

40 Sallust represents the Moors as a rem-
nant of the army of Heracles (de Bell. Ju-
gurth. c. 21.), and Procopius (Vandal. l. ii.
c. ιο.) as the posterity of the Cananaeans who
fled from the robber Jolhua (12:⁷5). He
quotes two columns, with a Phoenician in-
scription. Ι believe in the columns-1 doubt
the inscription—and Ι reject the pedigree.

*μ Virgil (Georgic. iii. 339.) and Pompo-
nius Mela (i. S.) describe the wandering life
of the African shepherds, similar to that of
the Arabs and Tartars; and Shaw (p. 222.)
is the best commentator on the poet and the
geographer.

4² The customary gifts were a ἠερίη, a
crown or cap, a white cloak, a figur-ed tunic
and shnes. all adorned with gold and silvei-3
nor were these precious mctals less acceptable
in the shape of coin (Procop. Vandal. 1. i.
c. 23.)-

ruins of the city. A crowd of spectreS‚ pale and emaciated, their
'bodies oppreffed with discase, aud their minds with despair, sur-
founded the palace of the governor, urged, with unavailing truth,
that it was the duty of a master to maintain his ssaveS, and humbly
requested, that he would provide for their subfistence‚ permit thei-r
ssight, or command their immediate execution. Beffas replied, with
unfeeling tranquillitnghat it was impoffible to feed, unsafe to dis-
miss, and unlawful to kill, the subjecte of the emperor. Yet the
example of a private citizen might have ihewn his countrymen that
a tyrant cannot withhold the privilege of death. Pierced by the
eries of five children, who vainly called on their father for bread, he
ordered them to follow his steps, advanced with calm and silent de-
spair to one of the bridges of the Tyber, and, covering his face,
threw himself headlong into the stream, in the presence of his fa-
mily and the Roman people. To the rich and pufillanimous, Beffas¹²
sold the permiflion of departure ; but the greatest part of the fugi-
tives expired on the public highways, or were intercepted by the
flying parties of Barbarians. In the mean while, the artful governor
soothed the discontent, and revived the hopes, of the Romans, by
-the vague reporte of the fleets and armies which were hastening to
''their relief from the extremities of the East. They derived more
rational comfort from the affurance that. Belisarius had landed at
the port ‚- and, without numbering his forces, they firmly relied on
the humanity, the courage, and the {kill of their great deliverer.

of thatimportant aet. A domestic monarch, who reigned over the C ἕως) P.
lives and fortunes of his children, might distribute their respective x--v—-ae
ssiares according to the degrees of their merit *or his affection: his
arbitrary displeasure chastised an unworthy son by the loss of his

inheritance and the mortifying preference of a stranger. But the

experience of unnatural parents recommended some limitatione. of

their testamentary powers. A son, or, by the laws of Justinian‚
eren a daughter, could no longer be dismherited by their filenee:
*they were compelled to name the criminal, and to specify the of-

that could justify such a violation of the first principles of nature
and society¹⁵³. Unless, a legitimate portion, a fourth part, had been
reserved for the children, they were entitlecl to institute an action or
complaint of inqfficious testament3 to suppose that their father's un-

derstanding was impaired by fickness cr age ; and respeffitfully to ap·-

admitted between the inheritance and the legacies. The heirs who
succeeded to the entire Unity, or to any of the twelve fraCtions of

the gifts of friendlhip or liberality which his last will had bequeathed

of a dying man might *exhaust the inheritance‚ and leave only silk

cidian porti0n3 to dedu& before* the payment of the lcgaeks, 'a
clear fourth for his own emolument. A reasonable ‘time was zal- ’

had been seduced by the arts of the usurper. Not a man was
tempted to desert the standard of the Gothic king. Belisarius soon
discovered, that he was sent to remain the idle and impotent speeia-
τοι· of the glory of a young Barbarian 3 and his own epistle exhibits
a genuine and lively picture of the distress of a noble mind. “ Most
‘⁴ excellent prime, we are arrived in Italy, destitute of all the ne-
“ cessary implements of war, men, horses‚ armS, and money. In
“ our late circuit through the villages of Thrace and Illyricum, we
“ have colleffited‚ with extreme difficulty, about four thousand re-
“ cruits, naked, and unskilled in the use of weapons and the ex-
“ ereises of the camp. The soldiers already stationed in the pro-
“ vince are discontented, fearsul‚ and dismayed3 at the found of
“ an enemy, they dismiss their horses, and cast their arms on the
“ ground. No taxes can be raised, fince Italy is in the hands of
“ the Barbarians: the failure of payment has deprived us of the
“ right of command, or even of admonition. Be affin-ed, dread fir,
“ that the greater part of your troops have already deserted to the
“ aoths. If the war could be atchieved by the presence of Belisa-
¹‘ rius alone, your wiffies are satisfied 3 Belisarius is in the midst of
“ Italy. But if you defu-e to conquer‚ far other preparatione are
‘⁶ requifite3 without a military force, the title os general is an empty
“ name. It would be expedient to restore to my service my own

“ veterans and domestic-,guarda Before I can take the field, Ι

“ must receive an adequate supply of light and heavy armed troops;

“ and it is only with ready money that you can proeure the indis-
‘⁶ pensable aid Of a powerful body of the cavalry of the Huns¹¹.”

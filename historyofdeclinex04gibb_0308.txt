disorders. The victorious eunuch pursued his march through Tus-

Rome with the remainder of his formidable host. Round the wide
circumference, Narses affigned to himself, and to each of his lieute-

of easy and unguarded entrance. Neither the fortifications of Ha-

drian's mole, nor of the port, could long delay the progress of the

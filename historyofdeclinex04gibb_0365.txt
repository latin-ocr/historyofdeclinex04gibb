OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Since the emperor declined the fame and envy of original compo-
fition, we can only require at his handS, method, choice, and fide-
lity, the httmble, though indispensable‚ virtues of a compilet. Among
the variouszeombinations of ideas, it is difficult to affign any reason-
able preference ; but as the order of Justinian is different in his three
works, it is possible that all may be wrong3 and it is certain that
two cannot be right. In the selection of ancient laws, he seems to
have viewed his predeceffors without jealousy, and with equal re.
gard: the series could not ascend above the reign of Hadrian, and
the narrow distindHon of Paganism and Christianity, introduced by
the superstitionssof Theodosius, had been abolished by the consent
’ of mankind: But the jurisprudenee of the Pandec'oe, is circumscribed
within a period of an hundred years, from the perpetual edi& to the
death of Severus Alexander: the civilians who lived under the first
Caesars, are seldom permitted to speak‚ and only three names can
be attributed to the age of the republic. The favourite of Justinian
(it has been fiercely. urged) was fearful of encountering the light
of freedom an'd the grav-ity⁴ of Roman fages. Tribonian 'con-
demned to oblivion the genuine and native wisdom of Cato, the
Scaevolas, and Sulpicius ; while he invoked spirits more congenial to
his own, the Syrians, Greeks, and Africans, who flocked to the
Imperial court to study Latin as a foreign tongue‚ and jurisprudence
as a lucrative profession. But' the ministers of Juf'tinian⁷⁵ were in-
structed to labour, not for the curiosity of antiquarianS, but for the
immediate benefit of his subjeets. It was their duty to sele& the
useful and prafflcal parts of the Roman law3 and the writings of
the old republicans, however curious 01· excellent, were no longer
suited to the new system of manners, religion, and government.

Schultingius (jurisprudentia Ante-justini- Francis Hottoman and his sestaries.

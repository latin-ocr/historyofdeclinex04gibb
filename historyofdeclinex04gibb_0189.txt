without impatience, the privation of her public baths. A large por..
tion of Rome, from the Praenestine gate to the chureh of St. Paul,
was never invested by the Goths; their excurfiOHS were restrained
by the a&ivity of the Moorish troops: the navigation of the Tyber,
and the Latin, Appian, and Ostian ways, were left free and un-
molested for the introdtl&ion of corn and cattle, or the retreat of the
inhabitants, who fought a refuge in Campania or Sicily. Anxious
to relieve himself from an useless and devouring multitude, Be-
iisarius iffued his peremptory orders for the instant departure of the
women, the children, and ssaves3 required his soldiers to dismiss
·their male and female attendants, and regulated their allovvance,
that one moiety should be given in provisions, and the other in
money. 'His forefight was justified by the enerease of the public
distress, as soon as the Goths had occupied two important posts in
the neighbourhood of Rome. By the loss of the port, or as ,it is
>now called, the city of Porto, he was deprived of the country on the
right of the Tyber, and the best communication with the sea; and
he refleeted with grief and anger, that three hundred men, could he
have spared such a feeble band, might have defended its impregnable
works. Seven miles from the capital, between the Appian and the
Latin ways, two principal aqueduCts croffing, and again crofling
each other, inclosed within their solid and lofty arches a fortified

sspacew, where Vitiges established a camp of seven thousand Goths

⁸⁷ Procopius (Goth. 1. ii. c. 3.) has forgot
to name these aquedu&s; nor can such a
double interfecerim, at such a distance from
Rome, be clearly ascertained from the writ-
ings of Frontinus Fabretti and Eschin ard, de
Aquis and de Agro Romano, or from the lo-
cal maps of Lameti and Cingolani. Seven

or eight miles from the city (30 stadia), on
the rond to Albano, between the Latin and
Appian way& Ι discern the remains of an
aquedu& (probably the Septimian), a series
(630 paces) of arches twenty-five fect high

After the Punic triumphs, the matrons of Rome aspired to the
common benefits of a free and opulent republic: their wishes were
gratified by the indulgence of fathers and lovers, and their ambition
was unsuccessfully refisted by the gravity of Cato the Censor¹²⁰.
They declined the solemnities of the old nupdals, defeated the an-
nual prescription by an absence of three days, and, without lofing
their name or independence, subscribed the liberal and definite terms
of a marriage-contract. Of their private fortunes, they communi-
cated the use, and secured the property: the estates of a wife could
neither-be alienated nor mortgaged by a prodigal husband3 their
mutual gifts were prohibited by the jealousy of the laws3 and
the miscondu& of either party might afford, under another name,
a future subject for an aetion of theft. To this loose and voluntary
compatet, religious and civil rites were no longer effential ; and, be-
tween persons of a fimilar rank, the apparent community of life
was allowed as sufficient evidence of their nuptials. The dignity
of marriage was restored by the Christians, who derived all spiritual
gracefrom the prayers of the faithful and the benedic‘tion of the
priest or bilhop. The origin, validity, and duties of the holy in-
stitution, were regulated by the tradition of the synagogue, the pre-
cepts of the gospcl‚ and the canons of general or provincial sy-
nods ¹²¹3 and the conscience of the Christians was awed by the de-
crees and censures of their ecclcfiastical rulers. Yet the magistrates
of Justinian were not subject to the authority of the church: the

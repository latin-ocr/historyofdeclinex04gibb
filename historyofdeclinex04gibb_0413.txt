of Greece still prevailed in the cities of Asia, and every vice was
fomented by the celibacy of the monks and clergy. Justinian re-
laxed the punishment at least of female infidelity3 the guilty sponse
was only condemned to solitude and penance, and at the end of two
years she might be recalled to the arms of a forgiving husband.
But the same emperor declared himself the implacable enemy of
unmanly lust, and the cruelty of his persecution can scarcely be
excused by the purity of his ,motives¹⁹⁵. In defi-auce of every
principle of justice, he stretched to past as well as future offences the
operations of his ediets, with the previous allowance of a {hort
respite for confeffion and pardon. A painful death was inflie'ted by
the amputation of the sinful instrument, or the insertion of ssiarp
reeds into the pores and tubes of most exquisite sensibility; and
Justinian defended the propriety of the execution, since the criminals
would have lost their hands had they been convieoed of sacrilege.
In this state of disgrace and agony, two bishops‚ Isaiah of Rhodes,
and Alexander of Diospolis, were dragged through the streets of
Constantinople‚ while their brethren were admonished by the voice
of a cryer, to observe this awful leffon, and not to pollute the
sanctity of their charaeter. Perhaps these prelates were innocent.
A sentence of death and infamy was often founded on the ssight
and suspicious evidence of a child or a servant: the guilt of the
green faition, of the rich, and of the enemies of Theodora, was
presumed by the judges, and paederasty became the crime of those to
whom no crime could be imputed. A French philosopher¹99 has

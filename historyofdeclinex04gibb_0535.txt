OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

guinary 'contests‚ by a modest enquiry into the doetriues of the pri-

mitive chureh ¹.

I. A laudable regard for the honour of the first proselytos, has
countenaneed the belief, the hope, the wilh, that the Ebionites‚ 01·
at least the Nazmenes, were distinguished only by their obstinate

perseverance in the praefice of the Mosaic rites.

Their chin-ebes

have disappeared, their books are obliterated 3 their obscure freedom

¹ By what means shall 1 authenticate this judgment‚ and his impartiality is sometimes

previous enquiry, which Ι have studied to cir-
cumscribe and compress ?—1f1 perfist in sup-
porting each fast or reflefflon by its proper
and special evidence, exery line would de-
mand a string of testimonies, and every note
would swell to a critical differrarion. But
the numberless passages of antiquity which Ι
have seen with my own eyes, are compiled‚
digested, and illustrated, by Petavius and
Le Clerc, by Bearfibre and Illofhcim. I shall
be content to fortisy my narrative by the
names and characters of these respeastable
guides; and in the contemplation of a rni-
nute or remote object, 1 am not ashamed to
borrow the aid of the strongest glaffes:
1. The Dogmata Theologica of petavius, are
a work of incredible lassour and compas33

the volumes which relate solely to the incar-

nation (two folios, „th and vim, of 837 pages),
are divided into xvi books—the first of histo-
ry, the remainder of controversy and doc-
trine. The Jesuit's learning is copious and
correo& his latinity is pure, his method clear,
his argument profound and well connefted:
but heis the ssave of the fathers, the seourge
of heretics, and the enemy of truth and can-
dour, as often as they are inimica} to the Ca-
tholic cause. z. The Arminian Le elei-c,
who has composed in a quarto volume (Am-
ilerdam, 1716) the ecclefiastical history of the
two first centus-ies, was ssee both in his tem.
per and situation5 his sense is clear, but his
thoughts are narrow; he reduces the reason
or folly of ages to the standard of his prix-aie

quickened, and sometimes tainted, by his op-
pofition to the fathers. See the heretics
(Cerinthians‚ lxxx. Ebionires, ciii. Carpo-
cratians, cxx. Valentinians‚ cxxi. Basilidi-
ans, cxxiii. Marcionites, cxli, &c.) under
their proper dates. 3. The Histoire Critique
du Manicheisme (Amsterdam, 1734, ¹739·
in two vols. in 41⁰, with a posthumous dis-
sertation sur les Nazarenes, Laustrnne, ¹743)
of M. de Beausobre, is a treasure of ancient
philosophy and theology. The learned his-
torian spins with incomparable art the sys-
tematic thread of opinion, and transforms
himself by turns into the person of a saint,
a fage, or an hereric. Yet his refinement is
sometimes exccffive: he betrays an amiable
partializy in favour of the iveni-:er sile, and,
while he guards against calum1=y‚ he does not
allow sufficient scope for sust-1 nilion and fa-
naticism. A crpious table of coutents uill
dire& the readcr to any point thar he willifs
to examine. 4. Less profound rhun l‘ezavius,
less independent than Le Clerc, less ingenious
than Beausobre, the historia„ Mothrim is full,
rational, corre-ft, and moderate. ln his learn-
ed work, De Rebus Christianis ante Conim-
tinum (Helmssadr, 1753, in 4³0), see the Na-
zarenes and Ebioniles, p. lym—179. 3²3*

434 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {sm-‘7³ P« prevailed both in the capital and the provinces3 the rich tremblcd

were ignorant or venal, the occafional remedies appear to have been

arbitrary ancl violent, and the complaints of the people could no

longer be filenced by the splendid names of a legissator and a con- ,

queror. The opinion which imputes to the prince all the calamities
of his times, may be countenanced by the historiam as a serious
truth or a salutary prejudice. Yet a candid suspicion will arise, that
that sentiments of Justin were pure and benevolent, and that he
might have filled his station without reproach, if the faculties of his
mind had not been impaired by disease, which deprived the em-
peror of the use of his feet, and confined him to the palace, a stranger
to the complaints of the people and the vices of the government.
The tardy knowledge of his own impotence determined him to lay
down the weight of the diadem3 and in the choice of a worthy sub-
stitute, he ihewed some symptoms of a discerning and even magna-
nimous spirit. The only son of Justin and Sophia died in his in-
fancy: their daughter Arabia was the wife of Baduarius²⁴ super-
intendant of the palace, and afterwards commander of the Italian
armies, who vainly aspircd to confirm the rights of marriage by
those of adoption. While the empire appeared an object of desire,
Justin was accustomed to behold with jealousy and hatred his bro-
thers and cousins, the rival& of his hopes3 nor could he depend on
the gratitude of those who would accept the purple as a restitution,
rather than a gift. Of these competitors, one had been removed
by exile, and afterwards by death3 and the emperor himself had

THE DECLINE AND FALL

every age and se& are the best entitled- to such infernal abodes. The
glory of the house of Saffan ended with the life of Chosroes: his
unnatural son enjoyed only eight months the fruit of his crimes3
and in the space of four yeme, the regal title was affumed by nine
candidates, who disputed, With the sword or dagger, the fragments
of an exhausted monarchy. Every province, and each city of Perfia,
was the scene of independence‚ of discord‚ and of blood, and the
state of anarchy prevailed about eight years longer, till the factions
were filenced and united under the common yoke of the Arabian
caliphs¹⁰⁸.

As soon as the mountains became paffable‚ the emperor received
the welcorne news of the success of the conspiracy, the death of
Chosroes, and the elevation of his eldest son to the throne of Perfia.
The authors of the revolution, eager to display their merits in the
court or camp of Tauris, preceded the ambaffadors of Siroes, who
delivered the letters of their master to his brother the emperor of
the Romans ¹⁰⁹. In the language of the usurpers of every age, 'he

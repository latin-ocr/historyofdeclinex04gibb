THE DECLINE AND FALL

C Π A Ρ· Belisarius laboured for pardon and reward in the fix books of the
ι--Χνῐζᾶ imperial edffices. He had dextroussy choscn a subject of apparent

splendofir, in which he could loudly celebrate -the genius, the mag-
nificencc, and the piety of a prince, who, both as a conqueror and le-
gissator‚ had surpafl'ed the puerile'virtues of Themistocles and Cyrus¹⁶.
Disappointment might urge the flatterer to secret revenge3 and the
first glance of favour might again tempt him to suspend and suppress
a libel¹⁷, iu which the Roman Cyrus is degraded into an odious and
contemptible tyrant, in which both the emperor and his consort Theo-

dora are serioussy represented as two daemons, who had assumed an “

human form for the destrudfion of mankind ἐ. Such base inconfistency
must doubtless sully the reputation, and detra& from the credit, of
Procopius: yet, after the venom of his malignity has been suffered
to exhale, the refidue of the anea-dotes, even the most disgraceful
facis, some of Which had been tenderly hinted in his public his-
tory, are established by their inter-nal evidence, or the anthentic
monuments of the times ¹⁹. From these various materials, I shall
now proceed to describe the reign of Justinian, which will deserve
and occupy an ample space. The present chapter will explain

de EdlfiClls περι nmo-(aaran) is no more than
Kvpu masia-a pun! In these five books,
Procopius affeas a Christian, as well as a

ι courtly style.

¹⁷ Procopius discloses himself (Praesat. ad
Anecdot. c. ι, z. 5.), and the anecdooes are
reckoned as the ixth book by Suidas (tom. iii.
p. 186. edit. Kuster). The silence of Eva-
grius is a poor objeftion. Buonius (A. D.
548. ΝΟ 24.) regrets the iuss of this secret
history: it was then in the Vatican libi-ary, iu
his own custody, and was first publifhcd sn:-
tecn years aster his death, with the learned,

but partini, notes of Nicholas ,alemannus
(Lugd. 1623.).

of Domitian (Anecdot. c. 8.)—Theodora’³
lovers driven from her bed by rival daemons—
her marriage foretold with a great daemon--a
monk saw the prince of the daemonS, instead
of Justinkm, cn the throne—the servants
who watche‹l‚ beheld a face without features,
a body walking without an head, ἃς. ἃς,
Procopius declares his own and his friends
belief in these diabolical stories (c. 12.).
¹⁹ Montesqvicu (Confidcraiions sur la
Grandeur ct la Decadence des Romaim,
c. xx.) gives c1cdit to these anecdotes, as

nian’s laws.

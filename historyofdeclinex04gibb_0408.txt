was never disturbed by sedition, and rarely polluted with atrocioris
crimes. The failure of penal laws was more sensibly felt when
every vice was inflamed by faQion at home and dominion abroad.
In the time of Cicero, each private citizen enjoyed the privilege of
anarchy: each minister of the republic was exalted to the tempta-
tions of regal power, and their virtues are entitled to the warmest
praise as the spontaneous fruits of nature or philosophy. After a -

damages of Sicily (Divinatio in Caecilium,
c„ 5.), which he afterwards reduced to qua-

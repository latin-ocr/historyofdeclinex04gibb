the value of a simple citizen. Less atrocious injuries, a wound, a frac-
ture, a blow, an opprobrious word, were measured with scrupulous and
almost ridiculous diligence; and the prudence of the legislator en-
couraged the ignoble practice of bai-tering honour and revenge for a pe-
cuniary compensation. The ignorance of the Lombards, in the state of
Paganism or Christianity, gave implicit credit to the malice and mis-
chief of witchcraft; but the judges of the seventeenth century might
have been instructed and confounded by the vvisdom cf Rotharis,
who derides the absurd superstition, and protects the wretched
victims of popular or judicial cruelty⁵⁵. The same spirit of a legis·-
lator, superior to his age and country, may be ascribed to Luitprand‚
who condemns, while he tolerates, the impious and inveterate
abuse of duels⁵⁵, observing from his own experience, that thejuster
cause had often been oppreffed by successful violence. XVhatever
merit may be discovered in the laws of the Lombards, they are the
genuine fruit of the reason of the Barbarians, who never admitted
the Bishops of Italy to a seat in their legissative councils. But the su-c-.
cellion of their kings is marked with virtue and ability ; the troubled
series of their annal-s is adorned with fair inter-vals of peace, order,
and domestic happiness; and the Italians enjoyed a milder and more

equitable government‚ than any of the other kingdoms which had
been founded on the ruins of the X'Vestern Empire ⁵⁷. x

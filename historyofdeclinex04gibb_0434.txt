the gates of the palace were flant, the arms removed, the attendants
dismiffed, and Rosamond, after lulling him to rest by her tender
careffes, unbolted the chamber-door, and urged the relu6'cant con-
spirators to the instant execution of the deed. On the first alarm,
the warrior started from his couch3 his sword, which he attempted
to draw, had been fastened to the scabbard by the hand of Rosa-
mond3 and a small stool, his only weapon, could not long prote&
him from the spears of the affaffins. The daughter of Cunimond
smiled in his fall; his body was buried under the stair-—case of the
palace, and the grateful posterity of the Lombards revered the tomb
and the mernory of their viffilorious leader. ν

The ambitious Rosamond aspired to reIgn in the name of her

lover3 the city and palace of Verona were avved by her power, and

a faithful 'band of her native Gepidae was prepared to applaud the
revenge, and to second the wishes, of their sovereign. But the Lom-
bard chiefs, who fled in the first moments of consternation and dis- ’
order, had resumed their courage and collected their powers3 and
the nation, instead of submitting to her reign, demanded with unani-
mous eries, that justice should be executed on the guilty spouse and
the murdcrers of their king. She fought a refuge among the⁴ ene-
mies of her country, and a criminal who desei-ved the abhorrence of
mankind was prote&ed by the selfiss1 policy of the exarch. With
her daughter, the heiress of the Lombard throne, her two lovers,
her trusty Gepidae, and the spoils of the palace of Verona, Rosa-
mond deseended the Adige aud the Po, and was transported by a
Greek veffel to the safe harbour of Ravenna. Longinus beheld with
delight the charnis and the treasures of the widow of Alboin: her
situation and her past conclu& might justify the most licentious pro-

posals3

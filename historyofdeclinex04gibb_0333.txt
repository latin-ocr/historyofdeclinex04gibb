covered with black pustules or carbuncles, the symptoms of imme-
diate death; and in the constitutions too feeble to produce an erup-
tion, the vomiting of blood was followed by a mortification of the
bowels. To pregnant women the plague was generally mortal:
yet one infant was drawn alive from his dead mother, and three
mothers survived the loss of their infeeted foetus. Youth was the
most perilous season; and the female sex was less susceptible than
the male: but every rank and profeffion was attacked with indis-
criminate rage, and many of those who escaped were deprived of
the use of their speech, without being secure from a return of the
disorder ⁹¹. The phyficians of Constantinople were zealous and
skilful: but their art was baffled by the various symptoms and per-
tinacious vehemence of the disease: the same remedies were pro·-

their prognostics of death or recovery. The order of funerals, and
the right of sepulchres‚ were confounded ; those who were left with-

heaps of dead bodies, to transport them by land or water, and to
inter them in deep pits beyond the precin&s of the city. Their

such men were guarded by the peculiar favour of fortune or pro-

plague had touched the person of Justinian himself: but the abst:-

01: THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 45¹

When the independent dukes agreed that Autharis ssiould ascend the C ξιξ Ρ·

throne of his father, they endowed the regal office with a fair μ-ν--ι
moiety of their respee'tive domains. The proudest nobles aspircd to

the honours of servitude near the person of their prince ι he rewarded

the fidelity of his valsals by the precarious gift of pensions and bene..

flces,· and atoned for the injurie-s of war, by the rich foundation of
monaster-ies and churches. In peace a judge, a leader in wal-,he never
usurped the powers of a sole and absolute legissator. The king

of Italy convened the national affemblies in the palace, or more
probably in the fields, of Pavia: his great council was compOsed of

the persons most eminent by their birth and dignitie33 but the
validity, as well as the execution of their decrees, depended on the
approbation of the fizithful people, the fhrtunate army of the Lom'-

bards. About fourscore years after the conquest of Italy, their tra-
ditional customs were transcribed in Teutonic Latin ²³, and ratified Laws,
by the consent of the prince and people; some new regulations 23.D.643,
were introduced, more suitable to their present condition; the example
of Rotharis was imitated by the wisest of his succeffors, and the
laws of the Lornbards have been esteemed the least imperfect of the
Barbarie codes ⁵⁴. Secure by their courage in the pofleffion of
liberty, these rude and hasty legissators were incapable of balancing
the powers of the constitution, or of discufling the nice theory of
political govermnent. Such crimes as threatened the life of the
sovereign‚ or the safety of the state, were adjudged worthy of death3
but their attention was principally confined to the defence of the
person and property of the subjest. According to the strange juris-

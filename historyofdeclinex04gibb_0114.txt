of fifty paceS‚ afforded a retreat to the cattle of the besieged. The
inner wall vas a monument of strength and beauty. it measured
fixty feet from the ground, and the height of the towers was one
hundred feet3 the loop-holes, from whence an enemy might be Ι
annoyed with missile weapons, were small, but numerous 3 the sol-
diers were planted along the rampart, under the ssielter of double
galleries, and a third platform‚ spacious and secure, was raised on
the summit of the towers. The exterior wall appears to have been
less lofty, but more solid 3 and each tower was proteti'ted by a qua-
drangular bulwark. A hard rocky soil refisted the tools of the miners,
and on the south—east, where the ground was more tractable, their
approach was retarded by a new work, which advanced in the shape

'of an half-moon. The double and treble ditches were filled with a

stream of water3 and in the management of the river, the most
{kilful labour was employed to supply the inhabitants, to distress the
befiegers, and to prevent the mischiefs of a natural or artificial in—
undation. Dara continued more than fixty years to fu'sfil the
wishes of its founders, and to provoke the jealousy of the Perfians‚
who inceffantly complained‚ that this impregnable fortress had been
construeted in manifest violation of the treaty of peace between the
two empires.

Iberia, and Albania, are interseeted in every direction by the branches
of Mount Caucasus3 and the two principal gates, or paffes, from
north to south, have been frequently confounded in the geography
both of the ancients and moderns. The name of Cqsjbian or Alba-
nian gates, is properly applied to Derbend ¹³⁸, which occupies a short

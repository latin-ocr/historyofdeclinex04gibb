five thousand soldiers and sailors‚ of five thousand hor-ses, of arms,
engines, and military stores, and of a sufficient stock of water and
provisions for a voyage, perhaps, of three months. The proud
gallies, which in former ages swept the Mediterranean with so many
hundred oars, had long since disappeared ; and the fleet of Justinian
was escorted only by ninety-two light brigantines‚ covered from the
miffile weapons of the enemy, and rowed by two thousand of the
brave and robust youth of Constantinople. Twenty—two generals are
named, most of whom were afterwards distinguished in the wars of
Africa and Italy z but the supreme command, both by land and sea
was delegated to Belisarins alone, with a boundless power of τιθείης
according to his discretion as if the emperor himself were present.
The separation of the naval and military profeffions is at once the

THE DECLINE AND FALL

dred and fifty archbishops and bishops have been counted in the dif-
ferent ages of the Jacobite church ; but the order of the· hierarchy
is relaxed or diffolved, and the greater part of their dioceses is con-

cities of Aleppo and Amida, which are often visited by the pa-

has gradually decreased under the oppreffion of twelve centuries.
Yet in that long period, some strangers of merit have been converted

and Armenians, who forgot their disputes, and mingled their tears
over the grave of an enemy. The se& which was honoured by the
virtues of Abulpharagius appears, however, to smk below the level
of their Nestorian brethren. The superstition of the Jacobites is

more abject, their fasts more rigidffl, their intestine divifions are

*eime33 and- instead of pronouncing a sentence of death against the W&

robber or affaflin, the general who betrayed an army, or the magi.-
strate who ruined a province, Sylla was content to aggravate the
pecuniary damages by the penalty of exile, or, in more constitu-
tional hmguage, by the interdiction of fire and water. The Cor-
nelian, and afterwards the Pompeiam, and Julian, laws introduced
a new system of criminal jurisprudence¹⁸⁶ ; and the emperors, from
Augustus to Justinian‚ disguised their encreafing rigour under the
names of the original authors. But the invention and frequent use
of extraordinary paim, proceeded from the defire to extend and
conceal the progress of despotism. In the condemnation. of illustri-
ous Romans, the senate was always prepared to confound, at the
will of their masters, the judicial and legissative powers. It was the
duty of the governors to maintain the peace of their province, by
the arbitrary and rigid administration of justice 3 the freedom of the
city evaporated in the extent of empire, and the SpaniIh malefactor,
who claimed the privilege of a Roman, was> elevated by the com-
mand of Galba on a fairer and >more lofty cross ¹⁸⁷. Occafional re·-
scripts iffued from. the throne to decide the questions which, by
their novelty or importance, appeared to surpass the authority and
discernment of a proconsul. Transportation and beheading were

reserved for honourable persons3 meaner criminals were either

accurately computes 40 vic'tims of the senato-
rian rank, and 1600 of the equestrian census
or order.

¹⁸⁶ For the penal laws (Leges Corneliae,
Pompeiae, Juliae, of Sylla, Pompey, and the
Caesars), see the sentences of Paulus (l. iv.
tit. xviii—xxx. p. 497—528. edit. Schuldng),
the Gregorian Code (Fragment. l. xix. p. 503,
706. in Schulting), the Collatio Legum Mo-

nian (l. ix.), the Pandefts (xlviii), the In-
stitutes (l. iv. tit. xviii.)‚ and the Greek ver-
sion of Theophilus (pl 917-926.).

hia ward. The crime was atrocious; yet the
punishment is reckoned by Suetonius (c. 9.)
among the aas in which Galba shewed him-

immodicus,

OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Pisa ⁸⁹, and Florence⁹⁰‚ and is now depofited as a sacred relie⁹¹ in
the ancient palace of the republie⁹². Ι

It is the first care of a reformer to prevent any future reformation·
To maintain the text of the Pandeecs, the Institutes, and the Cede,
the use of cyphers and abbreviations was rigoroussy proscribed 3 and
as Justinian recolle&ed‚ that* the perpetual edi& had been buried
u'nder the weight of commentatore, he denounced the punishment
of forgery against the rash civilians who should presume to interpret
οι· pervert the will of thei-r sovereign. The scholars of Accurfins, of
Bartolus, of Cujacius, should blush for their accumulated guih, unless
they dare to dispute his right of binding the authority of his succes-
sors‚ and the native freedom of the mind* But the emperor was
unable to fix his own inconstancy 3 and, while he boasted of renew-
ing the exchange of Diomede, of transmuting brass into gold ⁹³, he
discovered the neceffity of purifying his gold from the mixture of
bafer alloy. Six years had not elapsed from the publicationpof the

Code, before he condemned the imperfecst attempt, by a new and

⁸⁹ The discovery os the Passndeets at Amal-
phi (A.D. ¹¹37) is fxrst noticed (in ¹50¹)
by Ludovicus Bologninus (Brenckman, l. i.
c. xi. p. 73, 74. 1.iv. c. z. p. 4¹7-425=·)› on
the saith of a Pisan chronicle (p. 409, 410.)‚
without a name or a date. The whole story,
though unknown to the >tiith century, embel-
lilhed by ignorant ages, and suspected by rigid
cririeisrn, is nor, however, destitute of much
internal probability(l. i. c.4—-S. p. 17—50.).
The Liber Pandee‘tarurn of Pisa was undoubt-
edly consulted in the xix*h century 'oy the
great Bartolus (p. 406, 407. See l. i. c. 9.
p. 50—62.).

⁹⁹ l‘isa was taken by the Florentines in the
year ¹406; and in‘1411 the Pandee‘ts were
transported to the capital. These events are
aurlunnc and famous.

⁹¹ They were new bound in purple, depo-
fited in a rich casnet, and shewn to cutinus

travellers by the monks and magistrates bare-
headed, and with lighted tapers (Brenckman,
1. i. c. 10, ιι, 12. p.62—93.).

⁹² After the collatioris of Politian, Bolog-
ninus, and Antoninus Augustinus, and the
splendid edition of the Pandet‘ts by Taurel-
lus (in 1551), Henry Bronckman, a Dutch-
man, undertook a pilgrimage to Florence,
where he employed several years in the study
of a single manuscript. His Historia Pan·
deftarum Florentinorum (Utrecht, 1722, in
41⁰), though a monument of industry, is a
small portion of his original defign.

would surprise us in an aet of parliament.

Latin derivation³³3 and if we were sufficiently conversam with the
obsolete‚ the rustic, and the municipal dialedls of ancient Italy, we
ssmuld trace the origin of many ternis which might, perhaps, be
rejected by the claffic purity of Rome. A numerous army consti-
tutes but a small nation, and the powers of the Lombards were soon
diminissied by the retreat of twenty thousand Saxons, who scorned
a dependent situation, and returned, after many bold and perilous
adventures, to their native country ³⁹. The camp of Alboin was of
formidable extent, but the extent of a eam'p would be easily circum-
scribed within the limits of a city; and its martial inhabitants must
,be thinly scattered over the face of a large country. When Alboin
descended from the Alps, he investcd his nephew‚ the first duke of
Friuli, with the command of the province and the people3 but the
prudent Gisulf would have declincd the dangerous office, unless he
had been permitted to chuse, among the nobles of the Lombards, a
sufficient number of families ⁴⁰ to form a perpetual colony of soldiers
and subjeets. In the progress of conquest, the same option could
not be granted to the dukes of Brescia or Bergamo, of Pavia or
Tutin, of Spoleto or Beneventum3 but each of these, and each of
their coHeagues, settled in his appointed distri& with a band of
followers who resorted to his standard in war and his tribunal in
peace. Their attachment was free and honourable: refigning the
gifts and benefits which they had accepted, they might emigrate

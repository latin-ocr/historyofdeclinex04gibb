Persian might return to relate the melancholy tale. The great king
hastened to repass the Euphrates ; and Belisarius press'ed his retreat,
by afl'ecting to oppose a measure so salutary to the empne, and
which could scarcely have been prevented by an army of an hundred
thousand men. Envy might suggest to ignorance and pride, that
the public enemy had been suffered to escape: but the African and
Gothic triumphs are less glorious than this safe and bloodless vic-
tory, in which neither fortune, nor the valour of the soldiers‚ can
substra& any part of the general's renown. The second removal
of Belisarius from the Perfian to the Italian war, revealed the extent
of his personal merit, which had corrected or supplied the want of
discipline and courage. Fifteen generals, without concert or ss<ill‚
led through the mountains of Armenia an army of thirty thousand
Romans, inattentive to their fignaIs, their ranks‚ and their enslgns.
Four thousand Perfians, entrenched in the camp of Dubis, van-
quished, almost without a combat, this disorderly multitude3 their
useless arms were scattered along the mad, and their horses sunk
under the fatigue of their rapid flight. But the Arabs of the Roman
'party prevailed over their brethren; the Armenians returned to
their allegiance; the cities of Dara and Edessa refisted a sudden
affault and a regular siege, and the calamities of war were suspended
by those of pestilence. A tacit or formal agreement between the
two sovereigns‚ prote&ed the tranquillity of the eastern frontier ; and
the arms of Chosroes were confined to the Colchian or Lazic war,

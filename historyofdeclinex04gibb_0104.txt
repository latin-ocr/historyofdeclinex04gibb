THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A Ρ· Dacia, Epirus, Thessaly, Macedonia, and Thrace, appeared to

μῆρ’-ι cover the whole face of the country. six hundred of these forts were

built or repaired by the empe1·or; but it seems reasonable to believe,
that the far greater part consisted only of a stone or brick tower, in
the midst of a square or circular area, which was surrounded by a»
wall and ditch, and affor-ded in a moment of danger some protestion
to the peasants and cattle of the neighbouring villages¹'⁵. Yet these
military works‚ which exhausted the public treasure‚ could not re-
move the just apprehenfions of justinian and his European subj'eas.
The warm baths of Anchialus in Thrace were rendered as safe as
they were salutary; but the rich pastui-es of Thessalonica were fo-
raged by the Scythian cavalry3 the delicious vale of Tempe, three
hundred miles from the Danube, was continually alar-med by the
found of war¹¹⁶; and no unfortified spot, however distant or soli-
tary, could securely enjoy the bleffings of peace. The streights of
Thermopylae, which seemed to protect, but which had so often be-
trayed, the safety of Greece, were diligently strengthened by the la-
bours of Justinian. From the edge of the sea-›shore3 through the
forests and vallies, and as far as the summit of the Theffalian
mountains, a strong wall was continued, which occupied every
pra&icable entrance. Instead of an hasty crowd of peasants, a garri-
son. of t-wo thousand soldier-s was stationed along the rampart ;· grana-
ries of corn, and reservoirs of water, were provided for their use;
and by a precaution that inspired the cowardice which it foresaw,
convenient fortreffes were erec'ted for their retreat. The walls. of

OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

equally disappoint the prejudices of a papist or a protestant. It was C 11 A 1²„

the first care of the ministers of Rome to intercept all correspondcncc
with the Nestorian patriarch, and several of his bishops expired in
the prisons of the holy office. The floek, without a ssiepherd, was
affaulted by the power of the Portuguese, the arts of the jesuits‚
and the zeal of Alexis de Nlenezes archbiihop of Goa, in his per-
sona} visitation of the coast of Malabar0 The synod of Diamper, at
which he presided‚ consummated the pious work of the reunion,
and rigoroussy imposed the doctrine and discipline of the Roman
church, without forgetting auricular confession, the strongest engine
of ecclesiastical torture, The memory of Theodore and Nestorius
was condemned, and Malabar was reduced under the dominion of
the pope, of the primate, and of the Jesuits who invaded the see of
Angamala or Cranganor. Sixty years of servitude and hypocrisy
were patiently endured; but as soon as the Portuguese ‘empire
was ihaken by the courage and industry of the Dutch, the Nesto-
rians afferted, with vigour and effect, the religion of their fathers.
The Jesuits were incapable of defending the power which they had
abused: the arms of forty thousand Christians were pointed against
their falling tyrants3 and the Indian archdeacon affumed the cha-
racter of bishop, till a fresh supply of episcopal gifts and Syriae
miffionaries could be obtained from the patriarch of Babylon. Since
the expulfion of the Portuguese, the Nestorian creed is freely profeffed
on the coast of Malabar. The trading companies of Hoiland and
England are the friends of toleration; but if oppreffion be less mortify-
'mg than contempt, the Christians of St. Thomas have reason to com-
plain of the eold and filent indifference of their brethren of Europe¹²*.

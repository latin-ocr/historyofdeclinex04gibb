that the Jacobites of Egypt and Syria might be reconciled by the
profeflion of a doctrine, most certainly harmless, and most probably
true, fince it was taught even by the Nestorians themselves¹⁵‘. The
experiment was tried without effen, and the timid or vehement
,Catholies condemned even the semblance of a retreat in the pre-

observed by La Croze (Christianisme des In-

p. 218.). They seem ignorant that they
might aliege the positive authority of the ec-
thesis.

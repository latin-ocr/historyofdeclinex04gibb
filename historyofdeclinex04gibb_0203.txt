poisoning the wate1·s¹⁰⁵‚ and secretly {iring the gmnaries¹⁰⁶ of a be-
fieged city ¹⁰⁷. While he pressed the blockade of Ravenna, he was
surprised by the arrival of two ambass'adors from Constantinople‚
with a treaty of peace, which Justinian had imprudently figned,
without deigning to consult the author of his victory. By this dis-
graceful and precarious agreement, Italy and the Gothic treasure
were divided‚ and the provinces beyond the Po were left with the

regal title to the succeffor of Theodoric.

food ;> and the Roman chiefs, who murmured at the continuance of

the war, profeffed implicit submiffion to the commands of the cm·

peror. If Belisarius had poffeffed only the courage of a soldier, the
laurel would have been snatched from his hand by timid and en-

vious counsels3 but in this decisive moment, he resolved, with the

magnanimity of a statesman‚ to sustain alone the danger and merit·

of genereus disobedience. Each of his officers gave a written opi--

an accomplice in the mischief, which perhaps
was occafioned by accidental lightning.

¹⁰⁷ In stri& philosophy, a limitation of the
rights of war seems to imply nonsense and
contradiffion. Grotius himself is lost in an

idle distinffion between the jus naturae and
the jus gentium, between poison and infec-
tion. Hc balantes in one scale the passages
of Homer (Odyff. A. 239, &c.) and Florus
(l. ii. c. 20. Νο 7. ult.); and in the other,
the examples of Solon (Pausanias, l-x. c. 37.)
and Belisarius. See his great work De Jure
Belli et Pacis (l. iii. c. 4. s. ις, 16, ¹7· and

in Barbeyrac's verfion, torn. ii. p. 237, δια). .

Yet I can understand the benefit and validity
of an agreement, tacit or express, mutually
to abstain from certain modes of hostility.
